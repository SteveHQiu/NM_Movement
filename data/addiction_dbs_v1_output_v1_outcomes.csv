Despite advances in behavioral and pharmacological treatments, over 50% of those receiving treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) experience drug use recurrence (relapse). Given the prevalence of OUD and other substance use disorders (SUDs), the high rate of drug use recurrence, and the number of drug overdose deaths, novel treatment strategies are desperately needed. The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and feasibility of deep brain stimulation (DBS) targeting the nucleus accumbens (NAc)/ventral capsule (VC) and potential impact on outcomes in individuals with treatment-refractory OUD. METHOD(S): A prospective, open-label, single-arm study was conducted among participants with longstanding treatment-refractory OUD (along with other co-occurring SUDs) who underwent DBS in the NAc/VC. The primary study endpoint was safety; secondary/exploratory outcomes included opioid and other substance use, substance craving, and emotional symptoms throughout follow-up and 18FDG-PET neuroimaging. RESULT(S): Four male participants were enrolled and all tolerated DBS surgery well with no serious adverse events (AEs) and no device- or stimulation-related AEs. Two participants sustained complete substance abstinence for > 1150 and > 520 days, respectively, with significant post-DBS reductions in substance craving, anxiety, and depression. One participant experienced post-DBS drug use recurrences with reduced frequency and severity. The DBS system was explanted in one participant due to noncompliance with treatment requirements and the study protocol. 18FDG-PET neuroimaging revealed increased glucose metabolism in the frontal regions for the participants with sustained abstinence only. CONCLUSION(S): DBS of the NAc/VC was safe, feasible, and can potentially reduce substance use, craving, and emotional symptoms in those with treatment-refractory OUD.

Young Mania Rating Scale","Treatment resistance in alcohol use disorders (AUD) is a major problem for affected individuals and for society. In the search of new treatment options, few case studies using deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus accumbens have indicated positive effects in AUD. Here we report a double-blind randomized controlled trial comparing active DBS (""DBS-EARLY ON"") against sham stimulation (""DBS-LATE ON"") over 6 months in n = 12 AUD inpatients. This 6-month blind phase was followed by a 12-month unblinded period in which all patients received active DBS. Continuous abstinence (primary outcome), alcohol use, alcohol craving, depressiveness, anxiety, anhedonia and quality of life served as outcome parameters. The primary intention-to-treat analysis, comparing continuous abstinence between treatment groups, did not yield statistically significant results, most likely due to the restricted number of participants. In light of the resulting limited statistical power, there is the question of whether DBS effects on secondary outcomes can nonetheless be interpreted as indicative of an therapeutic effect. Analyses of secondary outcomes provide evidence for this, demonstrating a significantly higher proportion of abstinent days, lower alcohol craving and anhedonia in the DBS-EARLY ON group 6 months after randomization. Exploratory responder analyses indicated that patients with high baseline alcohol craving, depressiveness and anhedonia responded to DBS. The results of this first randomized controlled trial are suggestive of beneficial effects of DBS in treatment-resistant AUD and encourage a replication in larger samples.Copyright Â© 2023, The Author(s).",Translational Psychiatry,23-Dec,"Treatment resistance in alcohol use disorders (AUD) is a major problem for affected individuals and for society.

The symptoms of AUD are driven by dysfunction in several neurocircuits centered on the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Case reports and animal studies suggest NAc-DBS may be an effective harm-reduction treatment in severe AUD. Six patients with severe, refractory AUD underwent NAc-DBS. Safety metrics and clinical outcomes were recorded. Positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) was used to measure glucose metabolism in the NAc at baseline and 6 months. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to characterize postoperative changes in NAc functional connectivity to the rest of the brain, as well as NAc and dorsal striatal reactivity to alcoholic visual cues. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03660124. All patients experienced a reduction in craving. There was a significant reduction in alcohol consumption, alcohol-related compulsivity, and anxiety at 12 months. There was no significant change in depression. FDG-PET analysis demonstrated reduced NAc metabolism by 6 months, which correlated with improvements in compulsive drinking behaviors. Clinical improvement correlated with reduced functional connectivity between the NAc and the visual association cortex. Active DBS was associated with reduced activation of the dorsal striatum during passive viewing of alcohol-containing pictures. NAc-DBS is feasible and safe in patients with severe, otherwise refractory AUD. It is associated with a reduction in cravings and addictive behavior. A potential mechanism underlying this process is a down-regulation of the NAc, a disruption of its functional connectivity to the visual association cortex, and interference of cue-elicited dorsal striatum reactivity.

subthalamic nucleus","Objective: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective surgical treatment for patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). DBS therapy, particularly with the subthalamic nucleus (STN) target, has been linked to rare psychiatric com-plications, including depression, impulsivity, irritability, and suicidality. Stimulation-induced elevated mood states can also occur. These episodes rarely meet DSM-5 criteria for mania or hypomania. Method(s): The investigators conducted a chart review of 82 patients with PD treated with DBS. Result(s): Nine (11%) patients developed stimulation-induced elevated mood. Five illustrative cases are described (all males with STN DBS; mean age=62.2 years [SD=10.5], mean PD duration=8.6 years [SD=1.6]). Elevated mood states oc-curred during or shortly after programming changes, when more ventral contacts were used (typically in monopolar mode) and lasted minutes to months. Four patients experi-enced elevated mood at low amplitudes (1.0 V/1.0 mA); all had psychiatric risk factors (history of impulse-control dis-order, dopamine dysregulation syndrome, substance use disorder, and/or bipolar diathesis) that likely contributed to mood destabilization. Conclusion(s): Preoperative DBS evaluations should include a thorough assessment of psychiatric risk factors. The term ""stimulation-induced elevated mood states"" is pro-posed to describe episodes of elevated, expansive, or irri-table mood and psychomotor agitation that occur during or shortly after DBS programming changes and may be associated with increased goal-directed activity, impulsivity, grandiosity, pressured speech, flight of ideas, or decreased need for sleep and may persist beyond stimulation adjust-ments. This clinical phenomenon should be considered for inclusion in the bipolar disorder category in future DSM re-visions, allowing for increased recognition and appropriate management.Copyright Â© 2021, American Psychiatric Association.

Three members of the family suffered from treatment-refractory severe myoclonic jerks of the neck, trunk, and upper extremities. The mild dystonic symptoms recognized as cervical dystonia or truncal dystonia affected all individuals. The efficacy of pharmacotherapy, including anticholinergic, dopaminergic, and serotoninergic drugs, has failed. One individual developed an alcohol dependency and suffered from alcoholic epilepsy. Material(s) and Method(s): The patients were referred for stereotactic surgery. All individuals underwent bilateral implantation of deep brain stimulation (DBS) leads into the posteroventrolateral segment of the globus pallidus internus (GPi). Surgeries were uneventful. The formal preoperative objective assessment included the Unified Myoclonus Rating Scale (UMRS) and the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFMDRS). The postoperative UMRS and BFMDRS assessments were done only under continuous stimulation at 3, 6, and 12 months after the surgery and at the last available follow-up ranging from 6 to 15 months (mean, 10 months follow-up). Result(s): At the last follow-up visit, the rest and action parts of UMRS were improved by 93.3% and 88.2%, respectively, when compared to the baseline scores. The motor and disability scales of BFMDRS were improved by 77% and 43% at the last follow-up visit compared to the baseline BFMDRS scores. There were no hardware or stimulation-induced complications over the follow-up period. Positive social adjustment allowed two patients to regain jobs and one patient continued his education and hobbies. Conclusion(s): Our experience gathered in three individuals in the family with a mutation in SGCE indicates that bilateral GPi DBS can be an effective and safe treatment for disabling pharmacological resistant, intractable M-D syndrome.Copyright Â© 2022 International Neuromodulation Society",Neuromodulation,22-Aug,"Objectives: The study aimed to present a family with myoclonus dystonia (M-D) syndrome due to a mutation in the epsilon sarcoglycan gene (SGCE).

Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale","Background: While case series have established the efficacy of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in treating obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), it has been our experience that few OCD patients present without comorbidities that affect outcomes associated with DBS treatment. Here we present our experience with DBS therapy for OCD in patients who all have comorbid disease, together with the results of our programming strategies. Method(s): For this case series, we assessed five patients who underwent ventral capsule/ventral striatum (VC/VS) DBS for OCD between 2015 and 2019 at the University of Colorado Hospital. Every patient in this cohort exhibited comorbidities, including substance use disorders, eating disorder, tic disorder, and autism spectrum disorder. We conducted an IRB-approved, retrospective study of programming modifications and treatment response over the course of DBS therapy. Result(s): In addition to patients' subjective reports of improvement, we observed significant improvement in the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (44%), the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (53%), the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (27%), and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating scales (34.9%) following DBS. With respect to co-morbid disease, there was a significant improvement in a patient with tic disorder's Total Tic Severity Score (TTSS) (p = 0.005). Conclusion(s): DBS remains an efficacious tool for the treatment of OCD, even in patients with significant comorbidities in whom DBS has not previously been investigated.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for SUD and the effects of DBS on substance use, substance craving, emotional symptoms, and frontal/executive functions. DBS electrodes were implanted bilaterally within the Nucleus Accumbens/Ventral anterior internal capsule (NAc/VC) of a man in his early 30s with >10-year history of severe treatment refractory opioid and benzodiazepine use disorders. DBS of the NAc/VC was found to be safe with no serious adverse events noted and the participant remained abstinent and engaged in comprehensive treatment at the 12-week endpoint (and 12-month extended follow-up). Using a 0-100 visual analog scale, substance cravings decreased post-DBS implantation; most substantially in benzodiazepine craving following the final DBS titration (1.0 +/- 2.2) compared to baseline (53.4 +/- 29.5; p < .001). A trend toward improvement in frontal/executive function was observed on the balloon analog risk task performance following the final titration (217.7 +/- 76.2) compared to baseline (131.3 +/- 28.1, p = .066). FDG PET demonstrated an increase in glucose metabolism in the dorsolateral prefrontal and medial premotor cortices at the 12-week endpoint compared to post-surgery/pre-DBS titration. Heart Rate Variability (HRV) improved following the final titration (rMSSD = 56.0 +/- 11.7) compared to baseline (19.2 +/- 8.2; p < .001). In a participant with severe, treatment refractory opioid and benzodiazepine use disorder, DBS of the NAc/VC was safe, reduced substance use and craving, and improved frontal and executive functions.

The current literature on this syndrome is limited, and it remains underdiagnosed and challenging to manage. Objective(s): To assess the role of advanced therapies in the management of DDS. Method(s): We performed a retrospective chart review and identified patients who fit the inclusion criteria for DDS. They were classified according to risk factors that have been identified in the literature, motor and complication scores, intervention (medical or surgical) and outcome. Multivariate analyses were performed to analyze these characteristics. Result(s): Twenty-seven patients were identified (23 males, mean age of onset: 49 +/- 8.8 years). Average levodopa equivalent daily dose was 1916.7 +/- 804 mg and a history of impulse control disorders, psychiatric illness, and substance abuse was present in 89%, 70% and 3.7% of the patients, respectively.

Reduction of medications occurred with deep brain stimulation of subthalamic nucleus (P = 0.01) but was associated with a relapse in two patients.

Young Mania Rating Scale","Background: Drug addiction is one of the most prevalent and costly health problems worldwide. Over the past decade, deep brain stimulation (DBS) has increasingly been used for the treatment of drug addiction. Simultaneous DBS of nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC) has successfully been used for preventing heroin relapse. However, the excessive energy consumption speeds up battery depletion, which puts a burden on patients. By comparison, anterior capsulotomy is usually more convenient for patients and its clinical efficacy is similar to that of ALIC DBS. Accordingly, NAc DBS combined with anterior capsulotomy may also be an effective, yet more convenient, intervention for drug addiction and relapse prevention. Case Description: The patient was a 28-year-old man with a polysubstance use disorder (bucinnazine, morphine, and hypnotics) for 13 years. After bilateral NAc DBS combined with bilateral anterior capsulotomy, his craving for the three drugs decreased markedly, and he remained abstinent throughout the follow-up period of approximately 1-year. Moreover, psychiatric and neuropsychological assessments showed significant improvements in depression, anxiety, sleep, quality of life, and most aspects of cognitive functioning. His overall health status was also improved. Conclusion(s): NAc DBS combined with anterior capsulotomy is a promising surgical treatment for drug addiction.Â© 2020 S. Karger AG, Basel.

Case reports of juvenile HD (onset <= 20 years) describe heterogeneous motoric and non-motoric symptoms, often accompanied with a delay in diagnosis. We aimed to describe this rare group of patients, especially with regard to socio-medical aspects and individual or common treatment strategies. In addition, we differentiated between juvenile and the recently defined pediatric HD population (onset < 18 years). Method(s): Out of 2593 individual HD patients treated within the last 25 years in the Huntington Centre, North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), 32 subjects were analyzed with an early onset younger than 21 years (1.23%, juvenile) and 18 of them younger than 18 years of age (0.69%, pediatric). Result(s): Beside a high degree of school problems, irritability or aggressive behavior (62.5% of pediatric and 31.2% of juvenile cases), serious problems concerning the social and family background were reported in 25% of the pediatric cohort. This includes an attempted rape and robbery at the age of 12, as problems caused by the affected children, but also alcohol-dependency in a two-year-old induced by a non-HD affected stepfather. A high degree of suicidal attempts and ideations (31.2% in pediatric and 33.3% in juvenile group) was reported, including drinking of solvents, swallowing razor blades or jumping from the fifth floor with following incomplete paraparesis. Beside dopaminergic drugs for treatment of bradykinesia, benzodiazepines and tetrabenazine for treatment of dystonia, cannabinoids, botulinum toxin injection and deep brain stimulation were used for the improvement of movement disorders, clozapine for the treatment of tremor, and dopa-induced hallucinations and zuclopenthixole for the treatment of severe aggressive behavior. Conclusion(s): Beside abnormalities in behavior from an early age due to HD pathology, children seem to have higher socio-medical problems related to additional burden caused by early affected parents, instable family backgrounds including drug abuse of a parent or multiple changes of partners. Treatment required individualized strategies in many cases.Copyright Â© 2020 by the authors.

In this study, we investigated weight changes after deep brain stimulation of the ventral striatum/ventral capsule and to what extent changes are associated with connectivity to feeding-related networks. We retrospectively analyzed 25 patients undergoing deep brain stimulation for obsessive-compulsive disorder or substance dependency. Weight changes were assessed preoperatively and six to twelve months after surgery and then matched with individual stimulation sites and stimulation-dependent functional connectivity to a priori defined regions of interest that are involved in food intake. We observed a significant weight gain after six to twelve months of continuous stimulation. Weight increases were associated with medial/apical localization of stimulation sites and with connectivity to hypothalamic areas and the bed nucleus. Thus, deep brain stimulation of the ventral striatum/ventral capsule influences weight depending on localization and connectivity of stimulation sites.

The anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC) is also a potential target, as it carries fiber tracts connecting the mesocorticolimbic circuits that are crucially involved in several psychiatric disorders, including addiction. Stimulating the NAc and ALIC simultaneously may have a synergistic effect against addiction. Method(s): Eight patients with a long history of heroin use and multiple relapses, despite optimal conventional treatments, were enrolled. Customized electrodes were implanted through the ALIC into the NAc, and deep brain stimulation (DBS) treatment began two weeks after surgery. The patients were followed for at least 24 months. The duration of drug-free time, severity of drug cravings, psychometric evaluations, and PET studies of glucose metabolism before and after DBS were conducted. All adverse events were recorded. Result(s): With DBS, five patients were abstinent for more than three years, two relapsed after abstaining for six months, and one was lost of follow-up at three months. The degree of cravings for drug use after DBS was reduced if the patients remained abstinent (p < 0.001). Simultaneous DBS of the NAc and ALIC also improved the quality of life, alleviated psychiatric symptoms, and increased glucose metabolism in addiction-related brain regions. Moreover, stimulation-related adverse events were few and reversible. Conclusion(s): Simultaneous DBS of the NAc and ALIC appears to be safe, with few side effects, and may prevent long-term heroin relapse after detoxification in certain patients.

However, the implement of DBS treatment in addicted patients is currently controversial due to the significant associated risks. The aim of this study was mainly to investigate the therapeutic efficacy and safety of bilateral DBS of nucleus accumbens and the anterior limb of the internal capsule (NAc/ALIC-DBS) in patients with refractory opioid dependence (ROD). Methods and analysis: 60 patients with ROD will be enrolled in this multicentre, prospective, double-blinded study, and will be followed up for 25 weeks (6 months) after surgery. Patients with ROD (semisynthetic opioids) who meet the criteria for NAc/ALIC-DBS surgery will be allocated to either the early stimulation group or the late stimulation group (control group) based on the randomised ID number. The primary outcome was defined as the abstinence rate at 25 weeks after DBS stimulation on, which will be confirmed by an opiate urine tests. The secondary outcomes include changes in the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score for craving for opioid drugs, body weight, as well as psychological evaluation measured using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Fagerstrom test for nicotine dependence assessment, social disability screening schedule, the Activity of Daily Living Scale, the 36-item Short Form-Health Survey and safety profiles of both groups.

treatment outcome","Background Reports on behavioural outcomes after subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation in Parkinson's disease are controversial and limited to short-term data. Long-term observation in a large cohort allows a better counselling and management. Methods To determine whether a long-term treatment with subthalamic stimulation induces or reduces impulse control behaviours, neuropsychiatric fluctuations and apathy, 69 patients treated with subthalamic stimulation are prospectively and retrospectively assessed using Ardouin Scale of Behavior in Parkinson's Disease before and after 3-10 years of stimulation. Results At a mean follow-up of 6 years, all impulse control disorders and dopaminergic addiction were significantly decreased, apart from eating behaviour and hypersexuality. Neuropsychiatric fluctuations also significantly improved (ON euphoria: 38% of the patients before surgery and 1% after surgery, P<0.01; OFF dysphoria: 39% of the patients before surgery and 10% after surgery, P<0.01). However, apathy increased (25% of the patients after surgery and 3% before, P<0.01). With the retrospective analysis, several transient episodes of depression, apathy, anxiety and impulse control disorders occurred. Conclusions Bilateral subthalamic nucleus stimulation was overall very effective in improving impulse control disorders and neuropsychiatric fluctuations in parkinsonian patients in the long term despite a counteracting frequent apathy. Transient episodes of impulse control disorders still occurred within the follow-up. These findings recommend a close follow-up in parkinsonian patients presenting with neuropsychiatric symptoms before deep brain stimulation surgery.

Our study aimed to explore the functions of NAc and ALIC electrophysiologically. Method(s): The local field potentials (LFPs) of the NAc and ALIC were recorded from 7 heroin addicts treated with deep brain stimulation. Correlation analysis was made between LFP powers in various frequency bands and the subjects' neuropsychological test scores; coherence was calculated for the LFPs in NAc and ALIC. Result(s): Both the NAc and ALIC exhibited prominent theta and alpha frequency band activity in the LFP power spectra. Additionally, a distinct beta band peak was detected in the power spectra of ALIC LFPs, which may represent the activity of striatal bridge cells. There was a significant negative correlation between the power of the theta frequency band of ALIC LFPs and visual analogue scale (VAS) scores indicative of cravings (Spearman's rho = -0.758, P = 0.002), and a significant positive correlation was found between the power of the alpha frequency band of NAc LFPs and subjects' scores on the Hamilton depression inventory (rho = 0.727, P = 0.005). LFPs of the NAc and ALIC exhibited higher coherence values in the theta and alpha frequency bands. Conclusion(s): The results suggest that theta power in the ALIC/dorsal striatum and alpha power in the NAc may be associated with drug cravings and depressive symptoms, respectively, in heroin addicts. For these subjects, the neural activities in the dorsal and ventral striatum were mainly coordinated within the low-frequency band. Significance: The study illustrates the neurophysiologic characteristics of heroin addiction and its comorbidities, providing a potential theoretical basis for optimizing deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapy.Copyright Â© 2018 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology",Clinical Neurophysiology,18-Jun,"Objectives: The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is known to regulate the motivation and underlie addictive behaviors, and the anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC) is involved in several psychiatric disorders.

In neuropsychological examinations, Mini-Mental State Examination score was above the cutoff, but Frontal Assessment Battery suggested motor perseveration and disinhibition. In summary, the patient's excessive enthusiasm for painting emerged in association with impulse control disorder (ICD) by dopamine agonist therapy, and subsequent change in his painting style appeared to be related with motor perseveration and/or further escalation of ICD.Copyright Â© 2018 Clinical Neurolog.

One facet of self-control is the ability to forego smaller sooner rewards in favor of larger later rewards (delay discounting, DD). The NAc has been suggested to integrate motivational information to guide behavior while the consequences of NAc-DBS on DD are unknown. To this end, nine patients with SUD performed a DD task with DBS on and after a 24 h DBS off period. Furthermore, 18 healthy controls were measured to assess possible alterations in DD in patients with SUD. Our findings implicate that DD was not significantly modulated by NAc-DBS and also that patients with SUD did not differ from healthy controls.

*thalamus","The prevalence of essential tremor (ET) is about 4% above 40 years of age. Chronic alcohol consumption is present in around 20% of patients with ET. Our objective was to identify whether chronic alcohol consumption was associated with a negative effect on tremor outcome after thalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) in ET patients. We conducted a retrospective chart review, from January 2005 to December 2012, from which 23 patients who had ventral intermediate nucleus (Vim)-DBS surgery for ET were identified. Seven patients had a positive history of chronic alcohol consumption. We defined as chronic alcohol users those patients with a habit of drinking alcohol every day in order to suppress tremor. In the overall group of 23 patients, there was a reduction in the median tremor score from 8 pre-operatively, to 1 post-operatively (p < 0.0001). The alcohol consumers group experienced a reduction in the median tremor score from 6 pre-operatively to 0 post-operatively (p = 0.03). The non-alcohol consumers group had a reduction in the median tremor score from 8 pre-operatively to 1.7 post-operatively (p < 0.0001). Both groups of patients experienced significant benefit from thalamic DBS.

structured interview","Objective: To evaluate changes in the diagnosis of Axis I psychiatric disorders in patients with primary and secondary dystonia after deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi). Method(s): Structured Clinical Interviews for the DSM-IV, Axis I psychiatric disorders, were prospectively performed before and after surgery. Diagnoses were made based on DSM-IV criteria. Psychiatric disorders were grouped into 5 categories: mood, anxiety, addiction, obsessive-compulsive disorders, and psychosis. Patients could be stratified to more than one category. Rates for unchanged diagnoses, diagnoses in remission, and new-onset diagnoses after surgery for each category were calculated. Result(s): Fifty-seven patients with primary and secondary dystonia were included. Mean +/- SD age at surgery and dystonia duration at time of surgery was 50.6 +/- 13.8 and 19.0 +/- 13.2 years, respectively. Preoperatively, 37 Axis I diagnoses were made in 25 patients, 43.8% of those presenting with at least 1 Axis I diagnosis (mostly mood and anxiety disorders). Mean +/- SD duration of psychiatric follow-up was 24.4 +/- 19.6 months. Overall, after surgery no significant changes (p 0.16) were found in Axis I diagnoses (23 patients, 40.3%): 27 (73%) unchanged, 10 (27%) in complete remission, and 4 (12.9%) new-onset diagnoses. Conclusion(s): Our results support the overall psychiatric stability of patients with primary and secondary dystonia treated with GPi DBS. However, considering the high psychiatric morbidity in the dystonia population, psychiatric assessments before and after surgery are strongly recommended.

To date, few data are available on DDS risk factors, cognitive profile and long-term outcome. Methods In this retrospective case-control study, consecutive PD outpatients fulfilling criteria for DDS were assessed over a 6-year period (2005-2011). They were compared with 70 PD cases matched for age at onset, gender and disease duration, and with 1281 subjects with motor fluctuations and dyskinesias. DDS patients and matched controls underwent extensive neuropsychological assessment. Strategies for DDS patients management and the outcome at the last follow-up visit were recorded. Results Thirty-five patients with DDS were identified, reporting history of depression, family history of PD and drug abuse, greater difference between 'Off' versus 'On' motor symptoms compared to age-matched controls. They had younger age at onset (but not any gender difference) compared to general PD population. Cognitive profile of DDS did not show major abnormalities, including executive functions. DDS patients have been followed up for 3.2+/-2.1 years and remission was recorded in 40% of cases. Negative DDS outcome was significantly associated with poor caregiver supervision. Sustained remission occurred more commonly on clozapine and on duodenal levodopa infusion and subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) than on apomorphine pump treatment. Conclusions Clinicians should be aware of risk factors predisposing to DDS. Duodenal levodopa infusion and, less consistently, STN-DBS were more commonly associated with DDS remission.

The treatment approaches may be widely variable and there is not much information on these syndromes in the setting of deep brain stimulation (DBS). Objective(s): To evaluate (1) ICDs, DAWS and DDS pre-and post DBS in PD and (2) to investigate pre-DBS treatment strategies regarding these behaviors among Parkinson Study Group (PSG) centers. Method(s): Forty-eight PSG centers were surveyed on ICDs, DAWS and DDS, as well as on potential relationships to DBS and treatment approaches. Result(s): Sixty-seven percent of PSG centers reported that they served a population of over 500 PD patients per year, and 94% of centers performed DBS surgery. Most centers (92%) reported screening for ICDs, DAWS and DDS. Of the centers screening for these symptoms, 13% reported always employing a formal battery of pre-operative tests, 46% of sites inconsistently used a formal battery, while 23% of sites reported never using a formal battery to screen for these symptoms. The estimated numbers of centers observing ICDs, DAWS and DDS pre-operatively in individuals with PD were 71%, 69%, and 69%, respectively. PSG DBS centers observing at least one case of a new de novo occurrence of an ICD, DAWS or DDS after DBS surgery were 67%, 65% and 65%, respectively. Conclusion(s): The results suggest that addiction-like syndromes and withdrawal syndromes are prevalent in expert PSG centers performing DBS.

subthalamus","Background: Levodopa therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with non-motor complications resulting from sensitisation of the ventral striatum system. Recent studies showed an improvement in non-motor complications in PD patients with subthalamic stimulation. We hypothesised that ventral striatum desensitisation might contribute to this improvement. Method(s): Psychostimulant effects of levodopa were prospectively assessed in 36 PD patients with an acute levodopa challenge, before and 1 year after chronic subthalamic stimulation, using the Addiction Research Centre Inventory euphoria subscale. Postoperative evaluation was performed with the same dose of levodopa used in the preoperative assessment and after switching off stimulation. Preoperative and postoperative non-motor fluctuations in everyday life were investigated with the Ardouin Scale. Furthermore, in order to artificially reproduce non-motor fluctuations, a levodopa challenge keeping subthalamic stimulation on was performed to assess depression, anxiety and motivation before and after surgery under the different medication conditions. Result(s): After 1 year of chronic subthalamic stimulation with 60.3% reduction in dopaminergic medication, the acute psychostimulant effects of levodopa were significantly reduced compared with preoperatively, as measured by the euphoria subscale (7.22+/-4.75 vs 4.75 +/-5.68; p=0.0110). On chronic subthalamic stimulation and with markedly reduced dopaminergic medication, non-motor fluctuations were significantly improved. While off medication/on stimulation scores of depression and anxiety were improved, in the on medication/on stimulation condition the motivation score worsened. Conclusion(s): Acute psychostimulant effects of levodopa (off stimulation) were significantly reduced 1 year after surgery. These findings are likely due to desensitisation of the ventral striatum, allowed by the reduction of dopaminergic treatment, and the replacement of pulsatile treatment with continuous subthalamic stimulation.","Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry",13-Jan,"Background: Levodopa therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with non-motor complications resulting from sensitisation of the ventral striatum system.

Result(s): After 1 year of chronic subthalamic stimulation with 60.3% reduction in dopaminergic medication, the acute psychostimulant effects of levodopa were significantly reduced compared with preoperatively, as measured by the euphoria subscale (7.22+/-4.75 vs 4.75 +/-5.68; p=0.0110). On chronic subthalamic stimulation and with markedly reduced dopaminergic medication, non-motor fluctuations were significantly improved. While off medication/on stimulation scores of depression and anxiety were improved, in the on medication/on stimulation condition the motivation score worsened. Conclusion(s): Acute psychostimulant effects of levodopa (off stimulation) were significantly reduced 1 year after surgery. These findings are likely due to desensitisation of the ventral striatum, allowed by the reduction of dopaminergic treatment, and the replacement of pulsatile treatment with continuous subthalamic stimulation.","[[""The title/abstract implies that it is a review paper or meta-analysis"", ""No"", ""The abstract does not mention that it is a review paper or meta-analysis.""], [""The title/abstract implies that the study produced original data"", ""Yes"", ""The abstract mentions that the study prospectively assessed the psychostimulant effects of levodopa in PD patients before and after chronic subthalamic stimulation.""], [""The study investigates deep brain stimulation as a treatment for a condition"", ""Yes"", ""The abstract mentions that the study investigated the improvement in non-motor complications in PD patients with subthalamic stimulation.""], [""The study investigates transcranial direct or magnetic stimulation as a treatment for a condition"", ""No"", ""The abstract does not mention transcranial direct or magnetic stimulation as a treatment.""], [""The study investigates treatment for psychiatric or behavioral issues"", ""No"", ""The abstract does not mention treatment for psychiatric or behavioral issues.""], [""The study investigates treatment for addictions"", ""Yes"", ""The abstract mentions that the Addiction Research Centre Inventory euphoria subscale was used to assess the psychostimulant effects of levodopa.""], [""The study reports on a measure of clinical outcome after treatment"", ""Yes"", ""The abstract mentions that non-motor fluctuations in everyday life were investigated with the Ardouin Scale.""], [""The study investigates surgical treatments for psychiatric conditions or addictions"", ""No"", ""The abstract does not mention surgical treatments for psychiatric conditions or addictions.""]]","[false, true, true, false, false, true, true, false]",FALSE,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,TRUE

Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale","Background: Behavioural disorders associated with compulsive use of dopaminergic drugs for Parkinson's disease (PD) such as dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS) and impulse control disorders (ICDs) may have devastating consequences and are challenging to manage. Whether or not such patients should undergo subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) is controversial. A few case reports and small series have reported contrasting effects of STN DBS on dopamine misuse and ICDs, while a recent prospective study found clear beneficial effects of STN DBS on these disorders. Method(s): We conducted an observational study on 110 consecutive parkinsonian patients scheduled for STN DBS surgery. Patients were assessed preoperatively through extensive behavioural and psychiatric evaluations and divided into two groups: with or without compulsive dopaminergic medication use. Evaluations were repeated 1 year after surgery in both groups. Result(s): Before surgery 18 patients (16.3%) were compulsive dopamine users of whom 12 (10.9%) fulfilled all criteria for DDS. 90% of these patients also had at least one ICD compared to 20% in the group without compulsive dopamine use. One year after surgery, one patient had persistent compulsive dopamine use, while no new occurrences were reported in the group without the condition before surgery. STN DBS did not provoke any major psychiatric complications and ICDs were reduced in all patients. Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that STN DBS may reduce compulsive use of dopaminergic medication and its behavioural consequences.

reward","Background: The consequences of chronic alcohol dependence cause important health and economic burdens worldwide. Relapse rates after standard treatment (medication and psychotherapy) are high. There is evidence from in vivo investigations and from studies in patients that the brain's reward system is critically involved in the development and maintenance of addictive behavior, suggesting that modification of this system could significantly improve the prognosis of addictive patients. Motivated by an accidental observation, we used the nucleus accumbens (NAc), which has a central position in the dopaminergic reward system for deep brain stimulation (DBS) of alcohol addiction. Method(s): We report our first experiences with NAc DBS for alcohol dependence and review the literature addressing the mechanisms leading to addiction. Result(s): Five patients were treated off-label with bilateral NAc DBS for severe alcohol addiction (average follow-up 38 months). All patients experienced significant and ongoing improvement of craving. Two patients remained completely abstinent for more than 4 years. NAc stimulation was tolerated without permanent side effects. Simultaneous recording of local field potentials from the target area and surface electroencephalography while patients performed neuropsychological tasks gave a hint on the pivotal role of the NAc in processing alcohol-related cues. Conclusion(s): To our knowledge, the data presented here reflect the first attempt to treat alcohol-addicted patients with NAc DBS. Electrical NAc stimulation probably counterbalances the effect of drug-related stimuli triggering involuntarily drug-seeking behavior. Meanwhile, two prospective clinical studies using randomized, double-blind, and crossover stimulation protocols for DBS are underway to corroborate these preliminary results. Â© 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale","Objective: Stimulation of the inferior thalamic peduncle (ITP) is emerging as a promising new therapeutic target in certain psychiatric disorders. The circuitry that includes the nonspecific thalamic system (NSTS), which projects via the ITP to the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), is involved in the physiopathology of major depression disorder (MDD) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). The safety and efficacy of chronic ITP stimulation in cases of MDD and OCD refractory to medical treatment is presented. Material(s) and Method(s): Six patients with OCD and one with MDD were implanted with tetrapolar deep brain stimulation electrodes in the ITP (x = 3.5 mm lateral to the ventricular wall, y = 5 mm behind the anterior commissure, and z = at the intercommissural plane, i.e., anterior commissure-posterior commissure [AC-PC] level). The effect of chronic stimulation at 130 Hz, 450 mus, and 5.0 V on OCD was evaluated before and 3, 6, and 12 months after initiation of electrical stimulation through the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and Global Assessment of Function scale. Result(s): Chronic ITP electrical stimulation in OCD patients decreased the mean Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale score to around 51% for the group at the 12-month follow-up, and increased the mean Global Assessment of Function scale score to 68% for a significant improvement (P = 0.026). Three of 6 patients returned to work. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score of the only patient with MDD treated to date went from 42 to 6. This condition of the patient, who had been incapacitated for 5 years prior to surgery, has not relapsed for 9 years. Three OCD patients with drug addiction continued to consume drugs in spite of their improvement in OCD. Conclusion(s): Deep brain stimulation in the ITP is safe and may be effective in the treatment of OCD. A multicenter evaluation of the safety and efficacy of ITP in OCD is currently in process.

stereotaxic surgery","Background Stereotactic surgery has been used to treat heroin abstinence in China since 2000 by ablating the amygdaloid nucleus (AMY) and the nucleus accumbens (NAc), which also provides opportunity to identify the relationship between these nuclei and addiction. Our study aimed to explore the physiological and psychological effects of electrically stimulating the AMY and the NAc in heroin addicts after detoxification by observing changes of heart rate, arterial pressure and occurrence of euphoria similar to heroin induced euphoria. Methods A total of 70 heroin addicts after detoxification were recruited, and 61 of them were eligible to be given stereotactic surgery for heroin abstinence. The operation was carried out after determining the coordinates of all target nucleuses, and stimulation was performed at the AMY and the NAc solely or jointly. Heart rate, arterial pressure and occurrence of euphoria similar to heroin induced euphoria were recorded and analyzed. Results The average heat rate was (66+/-10) beats/min before electric stimulation, and significantly increased to (84+/-14) beats/min during stimulation, and changed to (73+/-12) beats/min 10 minutes after stimulation. There was a significant elevation of the average arterial pressure from 83 mmHg before stimulation to 98 mmHg during the stimulation, and it then decreased to 90 mmHg after stimulation. Forty-three of the 61 patients showed intense euphoria similar to heroin induced euphoria. The largest number (118/186) of euphoric responses occurred when the AMY and the NAc were stimulated at the same time. Odds ratio was 5.4 (95% CI: 2.4-11.9, P <0.0001) to quantify the association. Results from a Logistic regression model showed a positive correlation between unilateral stimulation of either the AMY or NAC and induction of euphoria (OR >1), especially when the left AMY or left NAc was stimulated (P <0.05). Conclusions Our data are consistent with existing results that the AMY and the NAc are related to addiction.

Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale","Addictions to dopaminergic drugs or to pleasant behaviours are frequent and potentially devastating neuropsychiatric disorders observed in Parkinson's disease. They encompass impulse control disorders, punding and dopamine dysregulation syndrome. A relationship with dopaminergic treatment is strongly suggested. Subthalamic stimulation improves motor complications and allows for drastic reductions in medication. This treatment might, therefore, be considered for patients with behavioural addictions, when attempts to reduce dopaminergic medication have failed. However, conflicting data have reported suppression, alleviation, worsening or new onset of behavioural addictions after subthalamic stimulation. Non-motor fluctuations are also a disabling feature of the disease. We prospectively investigated behaviour in a cohort of 63 patients with Parkinson's disease, before and 1 year after subthalamic stimulation using the Ardouin scale, with systematic evaluation of functioning in overall appetitive or apathetic modes, non-motor fluctuations, dopaminergic dysregulation syndrome, as well as behavioural addictions (including impulse control disorders and punding) and compulsive use of dopaminergic medication. Defined drug management included immediate postoperative discontinuation of dopamine agonists and reduction in levodopa. Motor and cognitive statuses were controlled (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, frontal score). After surgery, the OFF medication motor score improved (-45.2), allowing for a 73 reduction in dopaminergic treatment, while overall cognitive evaluation was unchanged. Preoperative dopamine dysregulation syndrome had disappeared in 4/4, behavioural addictions in 17/17 and compulsive dopaminergic medication use in 9/9 patients. New onset of levodopa abuse occurred in one patient with surgical failure. Non-motor fluctuations were significantly reduced with improvements in off-dysphoria (P0.001) and reduction in on-euphoria (P0.001). There was an inversion in the number of patients functioning in an overall appetitive mode (29 before versus 2 after surgery, P0.0001) to an overall apathetic mode (3 before versus 13 after surgery, P<0.05). Two patients attempted suicide. Improvement in motor fluctuations is linked to the direct effect of stimulation on the sensory-motor subthalamic territory, while improvement in dyskinesias is mainly explained by an indirect effect related to the decrease in dopaminergic drugs. Our data suggest that non-motor fluctuations could similarly be directly alleviated through stimulation of the non-motor subthalamic territories, and hyperdopaminergic side effects might improve mainly due to the decrease in dopaminergic medication. We show an overall improvement in neuropsychiatric symptomatology and propose that disabling non-motor fluctuations, dopaminergic treatment abuse and drug-induced behavioural addictions in Parkinson's disease may be considered as new indications for subthalamic stimulation.

withdrawal syndrome","Following recent advances in neuromodulation therapy for mental disorders, we treated one patient with severe alcohol addiction with deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Before and one year following the surgery, we assessed the effects of DBS within the NAc on the addiction as well as on psychometric scores and electrophysiological measures of cognitive control. In our patient, DBS achieved normalization of addictive behavior and craving. An electrophysiological marker of error processing (the error-related negativity) linked to anterior mid-cingulate cortex (aMCC) functioning was altered through DBS, an effect that could be reversed by periods without stimulation. Thus, this case supports the hypothesis that DBS of the NAc could have a positive effect on addiction trough a normalization of craving associated with aMCC dysfunction.

Patients with OCD may develop dependency upon compulsive behaviors because of the rewarding effects following reduction of obsession-induced anxiety. Reward processing is critically dependent on ventral striatal-orbitofrontal circuitry and brain imaging studies in OCD have consistently shown abnormal activation within this circuitry. This is the first functional imaging study to investigate explicitly reward circuitry in OCD. Method(s): Brain activity during reward anticipation and receipt was compared between 18 OCD patients and 19 healthy control subjects, using a monetary incentive delay task and functional magnetic resonance imaging. Reward processing was compared between OCD patients with predominantly contamination fear and patients with predominantly high-risk assessment. Result(s): Obsessive-compulsive disorder patients showed attenuated reward anticipation activity in the nucleus accumbens compared with healthy control subjects. Reduced activity of the nucleus accumbens was more pronounced in OCD patients with contamination fear than in patients with high-risk assessment. Brain activity during reward receipt was similar between patients and control subjects. A hint toward more dysfunctional reward processing was found in treatment-resistant OCD patients who subsequently were successfully treated with deep brain stimulation of the nucleus accumbens. Conclusion(s): Obsessive-compulsive disorder patients may be less able to make beneficial choices because of altered nucleus accumbens activation when anticipating rewards. This finding supports the conceptualization of OCD as a disorder of reward processing and behavioral addiction.

METHOD(S): Bipolar stimulating electrodes were bilaterally placed in the NAcc using stereotactic coordinates. In the first study, P rats (9 animals) were allowed to establish a stable pattern of alcohol intake (about 5-7 g/day) over approximately 2 weeks, and the acute effects of DBS in the NAcc (140-150 Hz, 60-microsec pulse width, and 200-microA current intensity) on alcohol intake and alcohol preference were studied. Each animal acted as its own control and received 1 hour of DBS followed by 1 hour of sham-DBS or vice versa on each of 2 sequential days. The order of testing (sham-DBS vs DBS) was randomized. In the second study, each animal was allowed to establish a stable alcohol intake and then the animal was deprived of alcohol for 4-6 weeks. Animals received DBS (6 rats) or sham-DBS (5 rats) in the NAcc for 24 hours starting when alcohol was reintroduced to each animal. RESULT(S): Deep brain stimulation in the NAcc, as compared with a period of sham-DBS treatment in the same animals, acutely decreased alcohol preference. Furthermore, alcohol consumption and preference were significantly reduced in the DBS group compared with the sham treatment group during the first 24 hours that alcohol was made available after a period of forced abstinence. CONCLUSION(S): The NAcc plays a key role in the rewarding and subsequent addictive properties of drugs of abuse in general and of alcohol in particular. Deep brain stimulation in the NAcc reduced alcohol consumption in P rats both acutely and after a period of alcohol deprivation. Therefore, DBS in the NAcc coupled with other neurophysiological measurements may be a useful tool in determining the role of the NAcc in the mesocorticolimbic reward circuit.

To date, there have been published different jobs in psychiatry with good results in OCD, MDD and GAD.

tobacco dependence","Aims: We explore whether clinical research on deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) to treat addiction is justified besides theoretical speculation. Method(s): Since 2004, 10 patients who were also smokers were treated at the University of Cologne for Tourette's syndrome (TS), obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD) or anxiety disorders (AD) by DBS of the NAc. We assessed their smoking behavior after DBS and (in retrospection) before by the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) and additional items. Result(s): Three male patients were able to quit smoking after DBS. They were less dependent and higher motivated compared to the rest of the sample. They are stimulated with a higher voltage. During 1-year, 2-year, and 30-month follow-ups, we found a higher rate of successful smoking cessation (20, 30 and 30%) compared to unaided smoking cessation in the general population (13, 19 and 8.7%). Conclusion(s): Albeit the results of the study are severely limited by the method of retrospective self-assessment of psychiatric patients, further research of DBS of the NAc to treat addiction seems justified.

DDS apparently developed for the first time after bilateral STN DBS in two patients, although only after a latency of eight years in one case. One patient without reported pre-operative DDS or ICDs developed pathological gambling post-STN DBS. One patient had pathological gambling which resolved pre-operatively, and did not recur post-DBS.

After previous medical treatment with Propranolol and Primidone failed, the patient resorted to alcohol, which greatly alleviated the symptoms. The downside of this situation, however, was that it led to alcoholism with severely disturbed liver enzymes and hepatic steatosis. Methods & Results: After DBS the patient was free of tremor and thus could easily abstain from alcohol. Conclusion(s): In time the elevated liver enzymes returned to normal, which indicates that sufficient tremor control by DBS can help these patients to abstain from alcohol.

Dysfunction of the nucleus accumbens, one of the main areas of the brain's reward system, seems to play a central role in addiction and treatment resistance. Following the recent advances of neuromodulation therapy by deep brain stimulation, we designed an off-label single patient study protocol to treat patients with severe and long-standing alcoholism in whom other treatment options had failed. We report here on the first three patients with alcoholism who received deep brain stimulation.

wellbeing","High-frequency deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) improves the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Opposite changes in mood, such as mania or depression, have been reported after surgery, but it is not known whether these side effects are specifically related to STN DBS. To learn whether STN DBS also influences the limbic loop, we investigated acute subjective psychotropic effects related to levodopa or bilateral STN DBS. After a median postoperative follow-up of 12 months, 50 PD patients completed the Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI), assessing subjective psychotropic effects in four conditions: off-drug/on-stimulation; off-drug/ off-stimulation; on-drug/off-stimulation; and on-drug/on-stimulation. Both levodopa and STN DBS improved all the ARCI subscales, indicating subjective feelings of well being, euphoria, increase in motivation, and decrease in fatigue, anxiety, and tension. A suprathreshold dose of levodopa was significantly more effective than STN DBS, using the same electrical parameters as for chronic stimulation, on four of the five ARCI subscales. We concluded that 1) both STN DBS and levodopa have synergistic acute beneficial psychotropic effects in PD, 2) the psychotropic effects of both treatments need to be considered in the long-term management of chronic STN DBS, and 3) the results indicate an involvement of the limbic STN in mood disorders of PD.

therapy","A 48-year-old woman with a stimulating electrode implanted in the right thalamic nucleus ventralis posterolateralis developed compulsive self-stimulation associated with erotic sensations and changes in autonomic and neurologic function. Stimulation effects were evaluated by neuropsychologic testing, endocrine studies, positron emission tomographic measurements of regional cerebral metabolic rate for glucose, EEG and evoked potentials. During stimulation, vital signs and pupillary diameter increased and a left hemiparesis and left hemisensory loss developed. Verbal functions deteriorated and visuospatial processing improved. Plasma growth hormone concentrations decreased, and adrenocorticotrophic hormone and cortisol levels rose. With stimulation, glucose metabolism increased in both thalami and both hemispheres, reversing baseline right-sided hypometabolism and right-left asymmetries. EEG and both somatosensory and brain-stem auditory evoked potentials remained unchanged during stimulation, while visual evoked potentials revealed evidence of anterior visual pathway dysfunction in the left eye.
