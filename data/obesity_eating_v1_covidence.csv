Effectiveness of Deep Brain Stimulation in Treatment of Anorexia Nervosa and Obesity: A Systematic Review,Hsu T.I.; Nguyen A.; Gupta N.; Godbole N.; Perisetla N.; Hatter M.J.; Beyer R.S.; Bui N.E.; Jagan J.; Yang C.; Gendreau J.; Brown N.J.; Oh M. ,"Objective: Anorexia nervosa and obesity are common appetite disorders, which may be life threatening if not treated and often coincide with psychiatric disorders. We sought to investigate whether deep brain stimulation (DBS) of specific regions within the brain could aid in the treatment of these disorders. This review aims to organize the literature regarding the feasibility of DBS via clinical outcomes and synthesize the data on patient demographics and electrode parameters for future optimization. Method(s): PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were all queried on 7 June 2022 to identify studies reporting the effect of DBS in treatment of either anorexia nervosa or obesity. We included studies involving 1) DBS, 2) treatment of anorexia nervosa or obesity, and 3) body mass index (BMI) as the primary outcome variable. Case reports, retrospective cohort studies, and randomized controlled trials were all eligible for inclusion. Exclusion of articles was based on the following criteria: 1) meta-analyses or systematic reviews or 2) describes diseases other than only anorexia or obesity. Screening of the 999 articles returned by an initial search yielded 23 studies for inclusion and further data extraction. Qualitative assessment of included studies was subsequently conducted in accordance with Newcastle-Ottawa Scale criteria. Result(s): We included 23 articles (17 anorexia, 5 obesity) that met our inclusion and exclusion criteria, which included 8 case reports, 13 case series, and 1 case-control study. Our primary variables of interest were location of DBS, change in BMI after intervention, electrode parameters, and psychiatric comorbidities. A total of 131 patients were included and analyzed, 118 of those belonging in the anorexia cohort. For patients with anorexia, we found that the most common place for DBS was the subcallosal cingulate followed by the nucleus accumbens, resulting in an overall increase in BMI by 24.82% over the span of a mean 17.1 months. Psychiatric comorbidities (major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and anxiety) were common in the anorexia cohort. For patients with obesity, DBS was most common in the lateral hypothalamus followed by the nucleus accumbens, resulting in a small decrease in BMI by 3.97% over a mean 17.2 months. Data were insufficient for this cohort to report on additional psychiatric comorbidities or calculate the duration from diagnosis to treatment. Conclusion(s): DBS seems to be a promising solution in addressing treatment-refractory anorexia, but additional prospective studies are still needed to confirm this same usefulness for the treatment of obesity. Primary limitations included the apparent lack of data on DBS for obesity as well as the dearth of cohort studies assessing efficacy of DBS compared with control treatments. Although these limitations could not be addressed in the current review, this study may incentivize future trials to assess DBS in patients with appetite disorders in a more controlled fashion.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s)",2022,/,World Neurosurgery,168,"(Hsu, Hatter, Beyer) University of California, Irvine, School of Medicine, Orange, CA, United States(Nguyen) University of Florida, College of Medicine, Gainesville, FL, United States(Gupta) Campbell University, School of Osteopathic Medicine, Lillington,",179-189,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2022.09.114,2020931756,#9,Hsu 2022,"",anorexia; obesity; review
Deep Brain Stimulation for Morbid Obesity: An Underutilized Neuromodulatory Treatment for Severely Obese Patients?,Stapinska-Syniec A.; Kupryjaniuk A.; Sobstyl M. ,"Background Morbid obesity (MO) has been steadily increasing in the last few years. Pharmacotherapy and bariatric surgeries remain the main treatment modalities for MO, although in the long-term they may lose their effectiveness. Other treatment approaches are urgently needed and deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a promising therapy. Disturbed energy homeostasis caused by intake of highly palatable and caloric foods may induce hedonic eating. The brain nuclei responsible for energy homeostasis and hedonia are the hypothalamic nuclei and nucleus accumbens. These brain structures constitute the stereotactic targets approached with DBS to treat MO. Material and Methods We have performed a literature search of all available clinical applications of DBS for MO in humans. We were able to identify three case series reports and additional six case reports involving 16 patients. The selected stereotactic targets included lateral hypothalamus in eight patients, ventromedial hypothalamus in two patients, and nucleus accumbens in six patients. Results In general, the safety profile of DBS in refractory MO patients was good. Clinical improvement regarding the mean body mass index could be observed in obese patients. Conclusions MO is a demanding condition. Since in some cases standardized treatment is ineffective, new therapies should be implemented. DBS is a promising therapy that might be used in patients suffering from MO, however, more studies incorporating more individuals and with a longer follow-up are needed to obtain more reliable results concerning its effectiveness and safety profile.Copyright © 2022 Georg Thieme Verlag.

Efficacy and safety of deep brain stimulation for treatment-refractory anorexia nervosa: a systematic review and meta-analysis,Karaszewska D.; Cleintuar P.; Oudijn M.; Lok A.; van Elburg A.; Denys D.; Mocking R. ,"Background: Several pioneering studies investigated deep brain stimulation (DBS) in treatment-refractory anorexia nervosa (AN) patients, but overall effects remain yet unclear. Aim of this study was to obtain estimates of efficacy of DBS in AN-patients using meta-analysis. Method(s): We searched three electronic databases until 1st of November 2021, using terms related to DBS and AN. We included trials that investigated the clinical effects of DBS in AN-patients. We obtained data including psychiatric comorbidities, medication use, DBS target, and study duration. Primary outcome was Body Mass Index (BMI), secondary outcome was quality of life, and the severity of psychiatric symptoms, including eating disorder, obsessive-compulsive, depressive, and anxiety symptoms. We assessed the risk of bias using the ROBINS-I tool. Result(s): Four studies were included for meta-analysis, with a total of 56 patients with treatment-refractory AN. Follow-up ranged from 6-24 months. Random effects meta-analysis showed a significant increase in BMI following DBS, with a large effect size (Hedges's g = 1 . 13; 95% CI = 0 . 80 to 1 . 46; Z-value = 6 . 75; P < 0 . 001), without heterogeneity (I2= 0 . 00, P = 0 . 901). Random effects meta-analysis also showed a significant increase in quality of life (Hedges's g = 0 . 86; 95% CI = 0 . 44 to 1 . 28; Z-value = 4 . 01, P < 0 . 001). Furthermore, DBS decreased the severity of psychiatric symptoms (Hedges's g = 0 . 89; 95% CI = 0 . 57 to 1 . 21; Z-value = 5 . 47; P < 0 . 001, I2= 4 . 29, P = 0 . 371). Discussion(s): In this first meta-analysis, DBS showed statistically large beneficial effects on weight restoration, quality of life, and reduction of psychiatric symptoms in patients with treatment-refractory AN. These outcomes call for more extensive naturalistic studies to determine the clinical relevance for functional recovery.

Effectiveness of Deep Brain Stimulation in Reducing Body Mass Index and Weight: A Systematic Review,Contreras Lopez W.O.; Navarro P.A.; Crispin S. ,"Background: Obesity has become a major public health concern worldwide, with current behavioral, pharmacological, and surgical treatments offering varying rates of success and adverse effects. Neurosurgical approaches to treatment of refractory obesity include deep brain stimulation (DBS) on either specific hypothalamic or reward circuitry nuclei, which might contribute to weight reduction through different mechanisms. We aimed to determine the safety and clinical effect of DBS in medical refractory obesity. Summary: Adhering to PRISMA guidelines, we performed a systematic review to identify all original studies - observational and experimental - in which DBS was performed to treat refractory obesity. From database inception to April 2021, we conducted our search in PubMed, Scopus, and LILACS databases using the following MeSH terms: ""Obesity""OR ""Prader-Willi Syndrome""AND ""Deep Brain Stimulation.""The main outcomes were safety and weight loss measured with the body mass index (BMI). The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methods were applied to evaluate the quality of evidence. This study protocol was registered with PROSPERO ID: CRD42019132929. Seven studies involving 12 patients met the inclusion criteria; the DBS target was the nucleus accumbens in four (57.1%), the lateral hypothalamic area in two (29.6%), and the ventral hypothalamus in one (14.3%). Further, 33% of participants had obesity secondary to Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and 66.6% had primary obesity. The global BMI average at baseline was 46.7 (SD: 9.6, range: 32.2-59.1), and after DBS, 42.8 (SD: 8.8, range: 25-53.9), with a mean difference of 3.9; however, the delta in PWS patients was -2.3 and 10 in those with primary obesity. The incidence of moderate side effects was 33% and included manic symptoms (N = 2), electrode fracture (N = 1), and seizure (N = 1); mild complications (41.6%) included skin infection (N = 2), difficulties falling asleep (N = 1), nausea (N = 1), and anxiety (N = 1). Key Messages: Despite available small case series and case reports reporting a benefit in the treatment of refractory obesity with DBS, this study emphasizes the need for prospective studies with longer follow-ups in order to further address the efficacy and indications.Copyright © 2021 S.

Deep brain stimulation in the management of paediatric neuropsychiatric conditions: Current evidence and future directions,Ashkan K.; Mirza A.B.; Tambirajoo K.; Furlanetti L. ,"Introduction: Neurosurgery has provided an alternative option for patients with refractory psychiatric indications. Lesion procedures were the initial techniques used, but deep brain stimulation (DBS) has the advantage of relative reversibility and adjustability. This review sets out to delineate the current evidence for DBS use in psychiatric conditions, with an emphasis on the paediatric population, highlighting pitfalls and opportunities. Method(s): A systematic review of the literature was conducted on studies reporting the use of DBS in the management of psychiatric disorders. The PRISMA guidelines were employed to structure the review of the literature. Data was discussed focusing on the indications for DBS management of psychiatric conditions in the paediatric age group. Result(s): A total of seventy-three full-text papers reported the use of DBS surgery for the management of psychiatric conditions matching the inclusion criteria. The main indications were Tourette Syndrome (GTS) (15 studies), Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) (20), Treatment Resistant Depression (TRD) (27), Eating Disorders (ED) (7) and Aggressive Behaviour and self-harm (AB) (4). Out of these, only 11 studies included patients in the paediatric age group (<=18 years-old). Among the paediatric patients, the indications for surgery included GTS, AB and ED. Conclusion(s): The application of deep brain stimulation for psychiatric indications has progressed at a steady pace in the adult population and at a much slower pace in the paediatric population. Future studies in children should be done in a trial setting with strict and robust criteria. A move towards personalising DBS therapy with new stimulation paradigms will provide new frontiers and possibilities in this growing field.Copyright © 2020 European Paediatric Neurology Society",2021,/,European Journal of Paediatric Neurology,33,"(Ashkan, Mirza, Tambirajoo, Furlanetti) Department of Neurosurgery, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK, United Kingdom(Ashkan, Mirza, Tambirajoo, Furlanetti) King's Health Partners Academic Health Sciences Centre, London, UK, United ",146-158,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpn.2020.09.004,2008362726,#39,Ashkan 2021,"",anorexia; non_specific; obesity; review
A systematic review on neuromodulation therapies for reducing body weight in patients with obesity,Gouveia F.V.; Silk E.; Davidson B.; Pople C.B.; Abrahao A.; Hamilton J.; Ibrahim G.M.; Muller D.J.; Giacobbe P.; Lipsman N.; Hamani C. ,"The global prevalence of obesity increases yearly along with a rising demand for efficacious, safe, and accessible treatments. Neuromodulation interventions (i.e., deep brain stimulation [DBS], transcranial magnetic stimulation [TMS], transcranial direct current stimulation [tDCS], percutaneous neurostimulation [PENS], vagus nerve stimulation [VNS], and gastric electrical stimulation [GES]) have been proposed as novel therapies. This systematic review sought to examine the safety and efficacy of neuromodulation therapies in reducing body weight in patients with obesity. Using PRISMA guidelines, we performed a systematic review for studies on neuromodulation for the treatment of obesity, resulting in 60 trials included (7 DBS, 5 TMS, 7 tDCS, 17 PENS and VNS, and 24 GES; a total of 3,042 participants). While promising results have been reported in open label studies, double-blinded randomized clinical trials often did not reach their primary endpoints, with no technique inducing a striking reduction in body weight. Bearing in mind the complexity and multifactorial nature of obesity, it is possible that a single treatment may not be enough for patients to lose or maintain the weight lost at long term.Copyright © 2021 World Obesity Federation",2021,/,Obesity Reviews,22,10,e13309,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/obr.13309,2013332574,#40,Gouveia 2021,"",non_specific; obesity; review
The utility of deep brain stimulation surgery for treating eating disorders: A systematic review,Potes M.I.; Joaquin C.; Wiecks N.; Phan S.; Hassan O. ,"Background: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has demonstrated preliminary success as a treatment for neuropsychological disorders including obsessive-compulsive disorder and substance use disorder. This systematic review aims to assess the use of DBS in treating eating disorders (EDs) to determine its utility and the extent of adverse effects. Method(s): A PubMed search following PRISMA guidelines was executed to find studies encompassing DBS as a treatment of ED. Outcomes were extracted from the literature and summarized while a review of quality was also performed. Result(s): From a search yielding 299 publications, 11 studies published between 2010 and 2020 were found to fit the inclusion criteria. Out of 53 patients who began with an abnormal BMI before treatment, 22 patients (41.5%) achieved normal BMI on follow-up. Significant neuropsychological improvement was seen in most patients as measured by neuropsychiatric testing and questionnaires. Conclusion(s): DBS as a treatment for ED may result in significant objective and psychological benefits. Further studies should aim to increase the sample size, standardize follow-up protocol, and standardize the neuropsychiatric tests used to determine psychological and physiological benefits.Copyright © 2021 Published by Scientific Scholar on behalf of Surgical Neurology International",2021,/,Surgical Neurology International,12,"(Potes) Department of Medical Education, School of Medicine, California University of Science and Medicine, Colton, CA, United States(Joaquin) Department of Clinical Education, Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine, Erie, PA, United States(Wiecks, Pha",169,,https://dx.doi.org/10.25259/SNI_730_2020,2011823989,#46,Potes 2021,"",anorexia; obesity; review
Current Therapeutic Approaches to Anorexia Nervosa: State of the Art,Muratore A.F.; Attia E. ,"Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a devastating psychiatric disorder characterized by extreme restriction of food intake and low body weight, both associated with significant medical and psychological morbidity. The clinical severity of AN has prompted the consideration and study of behavioral and pharmacological treatments in efforts to establish empirically based methods to reduce the burden of the disorder. Among adolescents, family-based treatment is considered a first-line behavioral treatment. Research continues to explore the efficacy of family-based treatment and predictors of treatment response to further improve outcomes. Several behavioral treatments for adults also exist, including cognitive-behavioral therapy, exposure and response prevention, third-wave acceptance-based treatments, and supportive psychotherapy, all of which help to improve symptoms and promote modest weight gain. Despite this, no one treatment is considered superior, and all existing behavioral approaches leave a proportion of adults symptomatic or at a high risk of relapse. As such, among adults, there is continued need for development of novel, mechanism-based approaches to better target the core symptoms of AN. Although antidepressants impart little benefit on weight or symptoms, the second-generation antipsychotic olanzapine has shown ability to promote modest weight gain in outpatients with AN. Most recently, the field's evolving conceptualization of AN as a biologically based disorder coupled with technological advancements has led to consideration of varying neuromodulation strategies as a potential therapeutic approach that remains under investigation.Copyright © 2020",2021,/,Clinical Therapeutics,43,1,85-94,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clinthera.2020.11.006,2010262306,#49,Muratore 2021,"",anorexia; non_specific; review
Brain stimulation in eating disorders: State of the art and future perspectives,Duriez P.; Khalil R.B.; Chamoun Y.; Maatoug R.; Strumila R.; Seneque M.; Gorwood P.; Courtet P.; Guillaume S. ,"The management of eating disorders (EDs) is still difficult and few treatments are effective. Recently, several studies have described the important contribution of non-invasive brain stimulation (repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation, and electroconvulsive therapy) and invasive brain stimulation (deep brain stimulation and vagal nerve stimulation) for ED management. This review summarizes the available evidence supporting the use of brain stimulation in ED. All published studies on brain stimulation in ED as well as ongoing trials registered at clinicaltrials.gov were examined. Articles on neuromodulation research and perspective articles were also included. This analysis indicates that brain stimulation in EDs is still in its infancy. Literature data consist mainly of case reports, cases series, open studies, and only a few randomized controlled trials. Consequently, the evidence supporting the use of brain stimulation in EDs remains weak. Finally, this review discusses future directions in this research domain (e.g., sites of modulation, how to enhance neuromodulation efficacy, personalized protocols).Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

Deep brain stimulation for the treatment of severe intractable anorexia nervosa,Sobstyl M.; Stapinska-Syniec A.; Sokol-Szawlowska M.; Kupryjaniuk A. ,"Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a challenging multifactorial disorder with the highest mortality rate among all psychiatric disorders. Due to the low rate of long-term treatment success, new treatment options are needed. Here, we review Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) as a treatment of Severe Intractable AN. The mechanisms of AN have shown significant involvement of the central nervous system especially the same brain regions which are involved with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). AN and OCD display many similarities in psychiatric practice such as compulsive behaviours and anxiety levels, which are related to networks in the brain, that can be altered using DBS. Our literature search revealed 8 studies totalling 28 individuals with AN and comorbid OCD or MDD. The most common stereotactic targets included the sub-callosal cingulate cortex (Brodmann area 25)/medial forebrain bundle (MFB) for AN and comorbid MDD and nucleus accumbens (NAc)/ventral striatum for AN and comorbid OCD. In most cases bilateral DBS of various structures of the reward system achieved good results in BMI, and core AN symptoms and psychiatric comorbidities showed sustained improvement. DBS is a promising treatment modality for AN and comorbid OCD or MDD. These results highlight promise and hope for patients with AN. However, further studies with larger patient populations are needed to shed light on the long-term outcomes of DBS and its effects in AN treatment.Copyright © 2019, © 2019 The Neurosurgical Foundation.",2019,/,British Journal of Neurosurgery,33,6,601-607,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02688697.2019.1667484,2003422760,#71,Sobstyl 2019,"",anorexia; review
Current and future directions of deep brain stimulation for neurological and psychiatric disorders,Lee D.J.; Lozano C.S.; Dallapiazza R.F.; Lozano A.M. ,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has evolved considerably over the past 4 decades. Although it has primarily been used to treat movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, and dystonia, recently it has been approved to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder and epilepsy. Novel potential indications in both neurological and psychiatric disorders are undergoing active study. There have been significant advances in DBS technology, including preoperative and intraoperative imaging, surgical approaches and techniques, and device improvements. In addition to providing significant clinical benefits and improving quality of life, DBS has also increased the understanding of human electrophysiology and network interactions.

Brain Stimulation to Modulate Food Intake and Eating Behavior,Dendy R.; Stinson E.J.; Guerithault N.; Gluck M.E. ,"Purpose of Review: Appetitive behaviors are mediated through homeostatic and reward signaling of brain circuits. There has been increasing interest in the use of neuromodulation techniques aimed at targeting brain regions such as the lateral prefrontal and subcortical regions associated with dysregulation of eating behaviors. Recent Findings: Invasive brain stimulation techniques have demonstrated promising results in treating severe and enduring anorexia nervosa and morbid obesity. In addition, non-invasive techniques have been shown to successfully reduce food craving, hunger ratings, and calorie intake as well as binge/purge symptoms in eating disorders. Summary: Brain stimulation offers promising results for treating symptoms associated with eating disorders and modifying appetitive behaviors including craving and caloric consumption. Future research should focus on identifying optimal frequency and duration of stimulation and employ longitudinal studies to assess long-term effectiveness on clinical outcomes such as eating disorder symptomatology, weight loss, and sustained improvements in eating behaviors over time.Copyright © 2019, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.",2019,/,Current Diabetes Reports,19,12,152,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11892-019-1250-2,2003804014,#74,Dendy 2019,"",anorexia; non_specific; obesity; review
Deep Brain Stimulation as a Treatment Approach for Anorexia Nervosa: A Systematic Literature Review,Silva L.J.D.; Naciff T.H.; Oliveira M.F.V.D. ,"Anorexia nervosa is a psychiatric disorder characterized by distortions of body size, weight, and shape perception, as well as by food restriction and/or binge and purging behaviors. It mostly affects young women and causes severe negative impacts on their physical, psychological, and social health. Recent studies have analyzed deep brain stimulation (DBS), a neurosurgical procedure that involves electrode implantation in strategical brain areas, to obtain remission of the symptoms of anorexia nervosa. The results showed that the stimulation of areas associated to the neurocircuitry of anorexia nervosa, such as nucleus accumbens, anterior cingulate cortex, ventral striatum, and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, provokes beneficial responses in terms of body mass index, quality of life, social functioning, and psychiatric comorbidities.

Neuromodulation in eating disorders and obesity: A promising way of treatment?,Jauregui-Lobera I.; Martinez-Quinones J.V. ,"Neuromodulation can affect the functioning of the central nervous system (CNS), and emotional/eating behavior is an exciting facet of that functioning. Therefore, it would be possible to offer an alternative (or complement) treatment to psychotropic medications and different psychological and nutritional approaches to both eating disorders (EDs) and obesity. Although there are a number of publications in these areas, a systematic review has not been conducted to date. Abstracts, letters, conference reports, dissertations, and reviews were excluded. Clinical trials and controlled human clinical trials were filtered and included in this study. Articles included were based on the population suffering from anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge ED, overweight, and obesity. No restrictions were placed on the sample size. Only trials investigating the effect of neuromodulation by means of deep brain stimulation (DBS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) were included. The following databases were used to conduct the search: MEDLINE/ PubMed, PsycINFO, PsycArticles, and Cochrane (Search Trials, CENTRAL). Study selection was performed following the PRISMA process (PRISMA 2009 Checklist). The total number of participants in all the trials was 562 (DBS, 25; tDCS, 138; TMS, 399; range, 3-90; median, 23.5). As a result, 50% of the studies had samples of between 14 and 38 participants. Neuromodulation in ED seems to have certain clinical potential, and therefore, this is a promising area for further research. Developments in ED neuromodulation will be linked to neuroimaging to identify potential stimulation targets and possible biomarkers of treatment response. To date, TMS and/or direct current stimulation (DCS) is not the first-line treatment yet, but it could become a preferred option of treatment in the future. Further studies should avoid small sample sizes and the use of different methodologies. Currently, neuromodulation techniques are in the experimental phase, and they are not an evidence-based treatment for ED.Copyright © 2018 Jauregui-Lobera and Martinez-Quinones.",2018,/,Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment,14,"(Jauregui-Lobera) Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemical Engineering, University of Pablo de Olavide of Seville, Seville, Spain(Martinez-Quinones) Department of Neurosurgery, Mutua de Accidentes de Zaragoza (Servicio de Neurocirugia), Zaragoza, S",2817-2835,,https://dx.doi.org/10.2147/NDT.S180231,625191054,#85,Jauregui-Lobera 2018,"",anorexia; non_specific; obesity; review
State of the Art: Novel Applications for Deep Brain Stimulation,Roy H.A.; Green A.L.; Aziz T.Z. ,"Objectives: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a rapidly developing field of neurosurgery with potential therapeutic applications that are relevant to conditions traditionally viewed as beyond the limits of neurosurgery.

Review Methods: An extensive literature review was carried out in MEDLINE, to identify relevant studies and review articles describing applications of DBS in the areas of trauma, neuropsychiatry and autonomic neuroscience. Result(s): A wide range of applications of DBS in these spheres was identified, some having only been tested in one or two cases, others much better studied. Conclusion(s): We have identified various avenues for DBS to be applied for patient benefit in cases relevant to trauma, neuropsychiatry and autonomic neuroscience.

Recent advances in deep brain stimulation in psychiatric disorders,Clair A.-H.; Haynes W.; Mallet L. ,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been offered to patients suffering of severe and resistant neuropsychiatric disorders like Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome (TS) and Major Depression (MDD). Modulation of several targets within the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits can lead to a decrease of symptom severity in those patients. This review focuses on the recent clinical outcomes in DBS in psychiatric disorders. Studies on OCD and TS are now focusing on the long-term effects of DBS, with encouraging results regarding not only the decrease of symptoms, but also quality of life. They also highlighted efficient adjuvant techniques, like cognitive and behavioural therapy and support programs, to enhance an often-partial response to DBS. The application of DBS for MDD is more recent and, despite encouraging initial open-label studies, two large randomised studies have failed to demonstrate an efficacy of DBS in MDD according to evidence-based medicine criteria. Last years, DBS was also tested in other resistant psychiatric disorders, as anorexia nervosa and addiction, with encouraging preliminary results. However, today, no target - whatever the disease - can meet the criteria for clinical efficacy as recently defined by an international committee for neurosurgery for psychiatric disorders. Consequently, DBS in psychiatric disorders still needs to proceed within the frame of clinical trials.Copyright © 2018 Clair AH et al.",2018,/,F1000Research,7,"(Clair, Haynes, Mallet) Sorbonne University, UPMC Paris 06 University, INSERM, CNRS, Institut du Cerveau et de la Moelle epiniere, Paris, France(Haynes) Neurosurgery department, University Hospital of Montpellier, Montpellier, France(Mallet) Psychiatry an",699,,https://dx.doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.14187.1,622465316,#88,Clair 2018,"",anorexia; non_specific; review
Deep brain stimulation for appetite disorders: a review,Whiting A.C.; Oh M.Y.; Whiting D.M. ,"The mechanisms of appetite disorders, such as refractory obesity and anorexia nervosa, have been vigorously studied over the last century, and these studies have shown that the central nervous system has significant involvement with, and responsibility for, the pathology associated with these diseases. Because deep brain stimulation has been shown to be a safe, efficacious, and adjustable treatment modality for a variety of other neurological disorders, it has also been studied as a possible treatment for appetite disorders. In studies of refractory obesity in animal models, the ventromedial hypothalamus, the lateral hypothalamus, and the nucleus accumbens have all demonstrated elements of success as deep brain stimulation targets. Multiple targets for deep brain stimulation have been proposed for anorexia nervosa, with research predominantly focusing on the subcallosal cingulate, the nucleus accumbens, and the stria terminalis and medial forebrain bundle. Human deep brain stimulation studies that focus specifically on refractory obesity and anorexia nervosa have been performed but with limited numbers of patients. In these studies, the target for refractory obesity has been the lateral hypothalamus, ventromedial hypothalamus, and nucleus accumbens, and the target for anorexia nervosa has been the subcallosal cingulate.

Therapeutic potential of deep brain stimulation of the nucleus accumbens in morbid obesity,Oterdoom D.L.M.; van Dijk G.; Verhagen M.H.P.; Jiawan V.C.R.; Drost G.; Emous M.; van Beek A.P.; van Dijk J.M.C. ,"OBJECTIVE Morbid obesity is a growing problem worldwide. The current treatment options have limitations regarding effectiveness and complication rates. New treatment modalities are therefore warranted. One of the options is deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus accumbens (NAC). This review aims to summarize the current knowledge on NAC-DBS for the treatment of morbid obesity. METHODS Studies were obtained from multiple electronic bibliographic databases, supplemented with searches of reference lists. All animal and human studies reporting on the effects of NAC-DBS on body weight in morbidly obese patients were included. Articles found during the search were screened by 2 reviewers, and when deemed applicable, the relevant data were extracted. RESULTS Five relevant animal experimental papers were identified, pointing toward a beneficial effect of high-frequency stimulation of the lateral shell of the NAC. Three human case reports show a beneficial effect of NAC-DBS on body weight in morbidly obese patients. CONCLUSIONS The available literature supports NAC-DBS to treat morbid obesity. The number of well-conducted animal studies, however, is very limited. Also, the optimal anatomical position of the DBS electrode within the NAC, as well as the optimal stimulation parameters, has not yet been established.

Expanding indications for deep brain stimulation,Doshi P.K. ,"It has been three decades since the first application of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for tremors was described by Benabid. Over the years, the indications for the performance of DBS have been expanding. There are now more than 1,50,000 patients around the world who have undergone DBS for various disorders. The main appeal of DBS is in its reversibility and titratability. Though the initial interest in DBS was for pain, the main indications for DBS have been movement disorders. Despite its wide appeal and 'perceived' advantage, United States Food and Drug Administration, the nodal agency for approving therapies, has been cautious and guarded in providing approvals. Only two indications, i.e., Parkinson's disease and tremors, have been approved; the two other indications, i.e., dystonia and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), have been granted exemption under the humanitarian device usage. However, the European community has been more liberal and several of these indications have CE (Conformite Europeene) approval. Most of them will be reviewed in this article. There have been numerous indications for which DBS has been applied, which in turn has helped to change the lives of several patients. Unfortunately, due to the paucity of the number of procedures performed and the inherent difficulty in conducting 'surgical' double blind randomized trials, Class 1 or Class 2 evidence for several of these indications is lacking. Hence, it is advisable that one does not embark on using each and any target for each and any indication without having the understanding or the team backup. It is cautionary that most of these therapies should be conducted in an institutional setting with an ethics and scientific committee backup and ably assisted by an experienced team.Copyright © 2018 Neurology India, Neurological Society of India  Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.",2018,/,Neurology India,66,7 Supplement 1,S102-S112,,https://dx.doi.org/10.4103/0028-3886.226450,621102845,#92,Doshi 2018,"",anorexia; non_specific; obesity; review
Deep brain stimulation as a therapeutic option for obesity: A critical review,Betry C.; Thobois S.; Laville M.; Disse E. ,"Despite a better understanding of obesity pathophysiology, treating this disease remains a challenge. New therapeutic options are needed. Targeting the brain is a promising way, considering both the brain abnormalities in obesity and the effects of bariatric surgery on the gut-brain axis. Deep brain stimulation could be an alternative treatment for obesity since this safe and reversible neurosurgical procedure modulates neural circuits for therapeutic purposes. We aimed to provide a critical review of published clinical and preclinical studies in this field. Owing to the physiology of eating and brain alterations in people with obesity, two brain areas, namely the hypothalamus and the nucleus accumbens are putative targets. Preclinical studies with animal models of obesity showed that deep brain stimulation of hypothalamus or nucleus accumbens induces weight loss. The mechanisms of action remain to be fully elucidated. Preclinical data suggest that stimulation of nucleus accumbens reduces food intake, while stimulation of hypothalamus could increase resting energy expenditure. Clinical experience with deep brain stimulation for obesity remains limited to six patients with mixed results, but some clinical trials are ongoing. Thus, drawing clear conclusions about the effectiveness of this treatment is not yet possible, even if the results of preclinical studies are encouraging. Future clinical studies should examine its efficacy and safety, while preclinical studies could help understand its mechanisms of action. We hope that our review will provide ways to design further studies.Copyright © 2018 Asia Oceania Association for the Study of Obesity",2018,/,Obesity Research and Clinical Practice,12,3,260-269,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.orcp.2018.02.004,620767201,#94,Betry 2018,"",obesity; review

We reviewed 50 studies involving six cognitive trainings: Approach and Attentional Bias Modification, Implementation Intentions, Response Inhibition, Episodic Future Thinking and Working Memory; and four neuromodulation approaches: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS), Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) and Neurofeedback. Response Inhibition and Implementation Intentions have shown to reduce unhealthy diet and weight in people with overweight/obesity. Attentional Bias Modification has shown promising results in healthy-weight participants. Brain stimulation of the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex via tDCS and the Hypothalamus via DBS showed benefits for reducing food craving and weight in people with overweight/obesity. Studies quality was generally high, but most trials were short-term and many conducted in healthy-weight samples. Modification of cognitive control and motivational processes/circuits are common mechanisms of beneficial training and neuromodulation interventions, and thus a promising approach for overweight/obesity treatment.

Neurostimulation in clinical and sub-clinical eating disorders: A systematic update of the literature,Dalton B.; Bartholdy S.; Campbell I.C.; Schmidt U. ,"Introduction: Whilst psychological therapies are the main approach to treatment of eating disorders (EDs), advances in aetiological research suggest the need for the development of more targeted, brain-focused treatments. A range of neurostimulation approaches, most prominently repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and deep brain stimulation (DBS), are rapidly emerging as potential novel interventions. We have previously reviewed these techniques as potential treatments of EDs. Aim(s): To provide an update of the literature examining the effects of DBS, rTMS and tDCS on eating behaviours, body weight and associated symptoms in people with EDs and relevant analogue populations. Method(s): Using PRISMA guidelines, we reviewed articles in PubMed, Web of Science, and Psy-cINFO from 1st January 2013 until 14th August 2017, to update our earlier search. Studies assessing the effects of neurostimulation techniques on eating and weight-related outcomes in people with EDs and relevant analogue populations were included. Data from both searches were combined. Result(s): We included a total of 32 studies (526 participants); of these, 18 were newly identified by our update search. Whilst findings are somewhat mixed for bulimia nervosa, neurostimulation techniques have shown potential in the treatment of other EDs, in terms of reduction of ED and associated symptoms. Studies exploring cognitive, neural, and hormonal correlates of these techniques are also beginning to appear. Conclusion(s): Neurostimulation approaches show promise as treatments for EDs. As yet, large well-conducted randomised controlled trials are lacking.

Deep brain stimulation-possible treatment strategy for pathologically altered body weight?,Prinz P.; Stengel A. ,"The treatment of obesity and eating disorders such as binge-eating disorder or anorexia nervosa is challenging. Besides lifestyle changes and pharmacological options, bariatric surgery represents a well-established and effective-albeit invasive-treatment of obesity, whereas for binge-eating disorder and anorexia nervosa mostly psychotherapy options exist. Deep brain stimulation (DBS), a method that influences the neuronal network, is by now known for its safe and effective applicability in patients with Parkinson's disease. However, the use does not seem to be restricted to these patients. Recent preclinical and first clinical evidence points towards the use of DBS in patients with obesity and eating disorders as well. Depending on the targeted area in the brain, DBS can either inhibit food intake and body weight or stimulate energy intake and subsequently body weight. The current review focuses on preclinical and clinical evidence of DBS to modulate food intake and body weight and highlight the different brain areas targeted, stimulation protocols applied and downstreamsignalingmodulated. Lastly, this review will also critically discuss potential safety issues and gaps in knowledge to promote further studies.Copyright © 2018 by the authors.

Advanced research on deep brain stimulation in treating mental disorders (Review),Wang D.; Liu X.; Zhou B.; Kuang W.; Guo T. ,"Deep brain stimulation is a method that involves using an electric stimulus on a specific target in the brain with stereotaxis. It is a minimally invasive, safe, adjustable and reversible nerve involvement technology. At present, this technique is widely applied to treat movement disorders and has produced promising effects on mental symptoms, including combined anxiety and depression. Deep brain stimulation has therefore been employed as a novel treatment for depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, habituation, Tourette's syndrome, presenile dementia, anorexia nervosa and other refractory mental illnesses. Many encouraging results have been reported. The aim of the present review was to briefly describe the mechanisms, target selection, side effects, ethical arguments and risks associated with deep brain stimulation. Although deep brain stimulation is a developing and promising treatment, a large amount of research is still required to determine its curative effect, and the selection of patients and targets must be subjected to strict ethical standards.Copyright © 2018, Spandidos Publications.

Brain stimulation in obesity,Gobel C.H.; Tronnier V.M.; Munte T.F. ,"Obesity is taking up epidemic proportions worldwide with significant impacts on the health of both the affected individual and on society as a whole. Treatment approaches consist of behavioural and pharmacological approaches, however, these are often found to be ineffective. In severe obesity, bariatric surgery is frequently performed. Unfortunately, 40% of patients show substantial weight gain over the long term or display the associated metabolic syndrome, making the development of novel therapies necessary. This review summarizes some of the current conceptual models, in particularly the 'food addiction' model, and then discusses specific therapeutic targets of brain stimulation, both non-invasive (transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (VNS)) and invasive (deep brain stimulation and invasive VNS). As we will show, neuromodulatory approaches represent a promising tool for targeting specific brain structures implicated in the pathophysiology of obesity. Non-invasive techniques such as TMS, tDCS and transcutaneous VNS need further investigation before they may become ready for clinical usage. The currently available study data suggest that deep brain stimulation may become an effective and acceptable therapy for otherwise treatment-resistant obese patients.

Neuromodulation and neurofeedback treatments in eating disorders and obesity,Dalton B.; Campbell I.C.; Schmidt U. ,"Purpose of review Psychological interventions are the treatment of choice for most eating disorders; however, significant proportions of patients do not recover with these. Advances in understanding of the neurobiology of eating disorders have led to the development of targeted treatments, such as deep brain stimulation (DBS), noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS), and neurofeedback. We review the emerging clinical evidence for the use of these interventions in eating disorders and obesity, together with their theoretical rationale. Finally, we reflect on future developments. Recent findings During the last 20 months, seven case studies/series and seven randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of NIBS or neurofeedback in different eating disorders, obesity, or food craving have appeared. These have largely had promising results. One NIBS trial, using a multisession protocol, was negative. A case series of subcallosal DBS in anorexia nervosa has also shown promise. A search of trial registries identified a further 21 neuromodulation/feedback studies in progress, indicating that neuromodulation/feedback is an area of growing interest. Summary At present, neuromodulation and neurofeedback are largely experimental interventions; however, growing understanding of the mechanisms involved, together with the rising number of studies in this area, means that the clinical utility of these interventions is likely to become clearer soon.Copyright © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Deep brain stimulation for obesity: From a theoretical framework to practical application,Nangunoori R.K.; Tomycz N.D.; Oh M.Y.; Whiting D.M. ,"Obesity remains a pervasive global health problem. While there are a number of nonsurgical and surgical options for treatment, the incidence of obesity continues to increase at an alarming rate. The inability to curtail the growing rise of the obesity epidemic may be related to a combination of increased food availability and palatability. Research into feeding behavior has yielded a number of insights into the homeostatic and reward mechanisms that govern feeding. However, there remains a gap between laboratory investigations of feeding physiology in animals and translation into meaningful treatment options for humans. In addition, laboratory investigation may not be able to recapitulate all aspects of human food consumption. In a landmark pilot study of deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the lateral hypothalamic area for obesity, we found that there was an increase in resting metabolic rate as well as a decreased urge to eat. In this review, the authors will review some of the work relating to feeding physiology and research surrounding two nodes involved in feeding homeostasis, nucleus accumbens (NAc) and hypothalamus, and use this to provide a framework for future investigations of DBS as a viable therapeutic modality for obesity.Copyright © 2016 Raj K.

Deep brain stimulation in mental health: Review of evidence for clinical efficacy,Fitzgerald P.B.; Segrave R.A. ,"Objective: There is increasing interest in the use of deep brain stimulation as a treatment for psychiatric disorders. In this review, we consider the evidence for the effectiveness of deep brain stimulation for psychiatric indications, with a primary focus on obsessive compulsive disorder and major depressive disorder. Method(s): Case reports, case series and clinical trials where deep brain stimulation was primarily utilised in the treatment of a psychiatric disorder, including obsessive compulsive disorder, major depressive disorder, anorexia nervosa or an addictive disorder were identified. The evidence for the effectiveness of deep brain stimulation in the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder and major depressive disorder was reviewed with studies clustered by the site of implantation. Result(s): The majority of identified manuscripts report small case series or single cases. A limited number of studies have reported some form of randomised or blinded stimulation comparison. All of these comparative reports have included small samples of subjects (less than 20 per study in total) compromising the feasibility of making statistical comparison between outcomes in the comparison phases. The two exceptions to this have been industry-sponsored studies conducted in the treatment of major depressive disorder. However, both were stopped prematurely due to concerns about poor efficacy. Conclusion(s): There is insufficient evidence at this point in time to support the use of deep brain stimulation as a clinical treatment for any psychiatric disorder outside of research and programmes where formal outcome data are being systematically collated.

Improved understanding of brain circuitries and their involvement in various neurological and psychiatric illnesses, coupled with the safety of DBS and its exquisite role as a tool for ethical study of the human brain, have unlocked new opportunities for this technology, both for future therapies and in research. Serendipitous discoveries and advances in structural and functional imaging are providing abundant ""new"" brain targets for an ever-increasing number of pathologies, leading to investigations of DBS in diverse neurological, psychiatric, behavioral, and cognitive conditions. Trials and ""proof of concept"" studies of DBS are underway in pain, epilepsy, tinnitus, OCD, depression, and Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, as well as in eating disorders, addiction, cognitive decline, consciousness, and autonomic states. In parallel, ongoing technological development will provide pulse generators with longer battery longevity, segmental electrode designs allowing a current steering, and the possibility to deliver ""on-demand"" stimulation based on closed-loop concepts.

Emerging neural models of ED provide a rationale for more targeted, brain-directed interventions. Aims This systematic review has examined the effects of neuromodulation techniques on eating behaviours and body weight and assessed their potential for therapeutic use in ED. Method All articles in PubMed, PsychInfo and Web of Knowledge were considered and screened against a priori inclusion/exclusion criteria. The effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), transcranial direct current stimulation, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) and deep brain stimulation (DBS) were examined across studies in ED samples, other psychiatric and neurological disorders, and animal models. Results Sixty studies were identified. There is evidence for ED symptom reduction following rTMS and DBS in both AN and bulimia nervosa. Findings from studies of other psychiatric and neurological disorders and from animal studies demonstrate that increases in food intake and body weight can be achieved following DBS and that VNS has potential value as a means of controlling eating and inducing weight loss. Conclusions Neuromodulation tools have potential for reducing ED symptomatology and related behaviours, and for altering food intake and body weight. In response to such findings, and emerging neural models of ED, treatment approaches are highly unlikely to remain 'brainless'. More research is required to evaluate the potential of neuromodulation procedures for improving long-term outcomes in ED. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and Eating Disorders Association.

Deep-Brain stimulation for anorexia nervosa,Wu H.; Van Dyck-Lippens P.J.; Santegoeds R.; Van Kuyck K.; Gabriels L.; Lin G.; Pan G.; Li Y.; Li D.; Zhan S.; Sun B.; Nuttin B. ,"Objective: Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a complex and severe, sometimes life-threatening, psychiatric disorder with high relapse rates under standard treatment. After decades of brain-lesioning procedures offered as a last resort, deep-brain stimulation (DBS) has come under investigation in the last few years as a treatment option for severe and refractory AN. Methods and Results: In this jointly written article, Sun et al. (the Shanghai group) report an average of 65% increase in body weight in four severe and refractory patients with AN after they underwent the DBS procedure (average follow-up: 38 months). All patients weighed greater than 85% of expected body weight and thus no longer met the diagnostic criteria of AN at last follow-up. Nuttin et al. (the Leuven group) describe other clinical studies that provide evidence for the use of DBS for AN and further discuss patient selection criteria, target selection, and adverse event of this evolving therapy. Conclusion(s): Preliminary results from the Shanghai group and other clinical centers showed that the use of DBS to treat AN may be a valuable option for weight restoration in otherwise-refractory and life-threatening cases. The nature of this procedure, however, remains investigational and should not be viewed as a standard clinical treatment option. Further scientific investigation is essential to warrant the long-term efficacy and safety of DBS for AN. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Neurosurgical treatment of anorexia nervosa: Review of the literature from leucotomy to deep brain stimulation,Lipsman N.; Woodside D.B.; Giacobbe P.; Lozano A.M. ,"This paper reviews the literature on the surgical treatment of refractory anorexia nervosa (AN) and examines how this literature can inform current circuit models of the disease. The literature contains reports of 35 patients undergoing a neurosurgical procedure for the specific treatment of refractory AN, with the first reported operation, a lobotomy, in 1950. All patients were deemed treatment resistant according to contemporary standards, with the nature of the procedure changing with evolving surgical techniques and methods. All procedures targeted the limbic system and, in a majority of cases, were associated with reported symptomatic improvement. Neurosurgery in AN has been, and continues to be, reserved for patients with chronic and life-threatening illness, for whom conventional treatment has failed. Early procedures, which were viewed as life-saving measures, were crude by today's standards but targeted anatomic structures and pathways implicated in modern models of AN. The last decade has seen a concerted effort in elucidating the neurocircuitry underlying prominent etiologic and maintaining factors in AN, including mood, anxiety and dysfunctional reward processing. This has translated into the development of novel, focused therapeutic options for patients with treatment-refractory AN. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and Eating Disorders Association.

Is deep brain stimulation a treatment option for anorexia nervosa?,Oudijn M.S.; Storosum J.G.; Nelis E.; Denys D. ,"Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe psychiatric disorder with high rates of morbidity, comorbidity and mortality, which in a subset of patients (21%) takes on a chronic course. Since an evidence based treatment for AN is scarce, it is crucial to investigate new treatment options, preferably focused on influencing the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of AN. The objective of the present paper was to review the evidence for possible neurobiological correlates of AN, and to hypothesize about potential targets for Deep brain stimulation (DBS) as a treatment for chronic, therapy-refractory AN. One avenue for exploring new treatment options based on the neurobiological correlates of AN, is the search for symptomatologic and neurobiologic parallels between AN and other compulsivity- or reward-related disorders. As in other compulsive disorders, the fronto-striatal circuitry, in particular the insula, the ventral striatum (VS) and the prefrontal, orbitofrontal, temporal, parietal and anterior cingulate cortices, are likely to be implicated in the neuropathogenesis of AN. In this paper we will review the few available cases in which DBS has been performed in patients with AN (either as primary diagnosis or as comorbid condition). Given the overlap in symptomatology and neurocircuitry between reward-related disorders such as obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and AN, and the established efficacy of accumbal DBS in OCD, we hypothesize that DBS of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and other areas associated with reward, e.g. the anterior cingulated cortex (ACC), might be an effective treatment for patients with chronic, treatment refractory AN, providing not only weight restoration, but also significant and sustained improvement in AN core symptoms and associated comorbidities and complications. Possible targets for DBS in AN are the ACC, the ventral anterior limb of the capsula interna (vALIC) and the VS. We suggest conducting larger efficacy studies that also explore the functional effects of DBS in AN. © 2013 Oudijn et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",2013,/,BMC Psychiatry,13,"(Oudijn, Storosum, Nelis, Denys) Department of Psychiatry, Academic Medical Centre, University of Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 5, 1105 AZ Amsterdam, Netherlands(Denys) Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience, Institute of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts a",277,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-244X-13-277,52848617,#158,Oudijn 2013,"",anorexia; review
Deep brain stimulation for obesity-from theoretical foundations to designing the first human pilot study,Tomycz N.D.; Whiting D.M.; Oh M.Y. ,"Obesity is perhaps an evolutionary consequence of a species reared with intermittent caloric reward. Humans are hardwired to enjoy food, and our bodies voraciously extract and store energy from food as if each meal was the last. As an amalgam of behavioral and metabolic disturbance, obesity is an attractive target for deep brain stimulation (DBS) since neuromodulation may be able to influence both eating behavior and metabolism. The current pandemic proportions of obesity combined with the failures and morbidity of modern treatments remain the impetus behind the application of DBS to this complex disease.

Obesity and brain addiction circuitry: Implications for deep brain stimulation,Taghva A.; Corrigan J.D.; Rezai A.R. ,"Obesity is a growing health problem worldwide and is responsible for a significant proportion of health expenditures in developed nations. It is also notoriously difficult to treat. Prior attempts at pharmacological or neurological modulation, including deep brain stimulation, have primarily targeted homeostatic mechanisms of weight control centered in the hypothalamus. To date, these attempts have had limited success. Multiple lines of independent data suggest that dysregulated reward circuitry in the brain underlies behaviors leading to obesity. Here, we review the existing data and related neurocircuitry, as well as the scope of obesity and currently available treatments. Finally, we suggest a neuromodulation strategy geared toward regulating these dysfunctional circuits, primarily by alteration of frontolimbic circuits.

Deep brain stimulation: Current and future clinical applications,Lyons M.K. ,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has developed during the past 20 years as a remarkable treatment option for several different disorders. Advances in technology and surgical techniques have essentially replaced ablative procedures for most of these conditions. Stimulation of the ventralis intermedius nucleus of the thalamus has clearly been shown to markedly improve tremor control in patients with essential tremor and tremor related to Parkinson disease. Symptoms of bradykinesia, tremor, gait disturbance, and rigidity can be significantly improved in patients with Parkinson disease. Because of these improvements, a decrease in medication can be instrumental in reducing the disabling features of dyskinesias in such patients. Primary dystonia has been shown to respond well to DBS of the globus pallidus internus. The success of these procedures has led to application of these techniques to multiple other debilitating conditions such as neuropsychiatric disorders, intractable pain, epilepsy, camptocormia, headache, restless legs syndrome, and Alzheimer disease. The literature analysis was performed using a MEDLINE search from 1980 through 2010 with the term deep brain stimulation, and several double-blind and larger case series were chosen for inclusion in this review. The exact mechanism of DBS is not fully understood.

Rationale for hypothalamus-deep brain stimulation in food intake disorders and obesity,Torres N.; Chabardes S.; Benabid A.L. ,"Appetite modulation in conjunction with enhancing metabolic rate with hypothalamic lesions has been widely documented in animal and even in humans. It appears these effects can be reproduced by DBS, and the titratability and reversibility of this procedure, in addition to well established safety profile, make DBS an appealing option for obesity treatment. Targeting the hypothalamus with DBS has already been shown to be feasible and potentially effective in managing patients with intractable chronic cluster headache [26]. The surgical risk however must be cautiously taken into account when targeting the hypothalamus, where some mortality cases have been reported when targeting the posterior part [34]. The development of new surgical approach will probably reduce this surgical risk. Moreover, the role of functional neurosurgery in obesity is not a new idea. In fact, LH was targeted in obese humans with electrocoagulation more than 30 years ago, resulting in significant yet transient appetite suppression and slight weight reduction [36]. All those elements have made possible the recent regain of interest in DBS for morbid obesity and open an exciting new area of research in neurosurgery and endocrinology.",2011,/,Advances and technical standards in neurosurgery,36,"(Torres) CEA CLINATEC, Grenoble, France.",17-30,,,560080678,#177,Torres 2011,"",obesity; review
Deep brain stimulation compared with bariatric surgery for the treatment of morbid obesity: a decision analysis study,Pisapia J.M.; Halpern C.H.; Williams N.N.; Wadden T.A.; Baltuch G.H.; Stein S.C. ,"OBJECT: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is the gold standard treatment for morbid obesity, although failure rates may be high, particularly in patients with a BMI > 50 kg/m(2). With improved understanding of the neuropsychiatric basis of obesity, deep brain stimulation (DBS) offers a less invasive and reversible alternative to available surgical treatments. In this decision analysis, the authors determined the success rate at which DBS would be equivalent to the two most common bariatric surgeries. METHOD(S): Medline searches were performed for studies of laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB), laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB), and DBS for movement disorders. Bariatric surgery was considered successful if postoperative excess weight loss exceeded 45% at 1-year follow-up. Using complication and success rates from the literature, the authors constructed a decision analysis model for treatment by LAGB, LRYGB, DBS, or no surgical treatment. A sensitivity analysis in which major parameters were systematically varied within their 95% CIs was used. RESULT(S): Fifteen studies involving 3489 and 3306 cases of LAGB and LRYGB, respectively, and 45 studies involving 2937 cases treated with DBS were included. The operative successes were 0.30 (95% CI 0.247-0.358) for LAGB and 0.968 (95% CI 0.967-0.969) for LRYGB. Sensitivity analysis revealed utility of surgical complications in LRYGB, probability of surgical complications in DBS, and success rate of DBS as having the greatest influence on outcomes. At no values did LAGB result in superior outcomes compared with other treatments. CONCLUSION(S): Deep brain stimulation must achieve a success rate of 83% to be equivalent to bariatric surgery. This high-threshold success rate is probably due to the reported success rate of LRYGB, despite its higher complication rate (33.4%) compared with DBS (19.4%).

Deep brain stimulation in the treatment of obesity: A review,Halpern C.H.; Wolf J.A.; Bale T.L.; Stunkard A.J.; Danish S.F.; Grossman M.; Jaggi J.L.; Grady M.S.; Baltuch G.H. ,"Obesity is a growing global health problem frequently intractable to current treatment options. Recent evidence suggests that deep brain stimulation (DBS) may be effective and safe in the management of various, refractory neuropsychiatric disorders, including obesity. The authors review the literature implicating various neural regions in the pathophysiology of obesity, as well as the evidence supporting these regions as targets for DBS, in order to explore the therapeutic promise of DBS in obesity. The lateral hypothalamus and ventromedial hypothalamus are the appetite and satiety centers in the brain, respectively. Substantial data support targeting these regions with DBS for the purpose of appetite suppression and weight loss. However, reward sensation associated with highly caloric food has been implicated in overconsumption as well as obesity, and may in part explain the failure rates of conservative management and bariatric surgery. Thus, regions of the brain's reward circuitry, such as the nucleus accumbens, are promising alternatives for DBS in obesity control.

Cognitive and quality-of-life related factors of body mass index (BMI) improvement after deep brain stimulation in the subcallosal cingulate and nucleus accumbens in treatment-refractory chronic anorexia nervosa,Perez V.; Villalba-Martinez G.; Elices M.; Manero R.M.; Salgado P.; Gines J.M.; Guardiola R.; Cedron C.; Polo M.; Delgado-Martinez I.; Conesa G.; Medrano S.; Portella M.J. ,"Background: Up to 20% of the cases of anorexia nervosa (AN) are chronic and treatment-resistant. Recently, the efficacy of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for severe cases of AN has been explored, with studies showing an improvement in body mass index and other psychiatric outcomes. While the effects of DBS on cognitive domains have been studied in patients with other neurological and psychiatric conditions so far, no evidence has been gathered in AN. Method(s): Eight patients with severe, chronic, treatment-resistant AN received DBS either to the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) or subcallosal cingulate (SCC; four subjects on each target). A comprehensive battery of neuropsychological and clinical outcomes was used before and 6-month after surgery. Finding(s): Although Body Mass Index (BMI) did not normalise, statistically significant improvements in BMI, quality of life, and performance on cognitive flexibility were observed after 6 months of DBS. Changes in BMI were related to a decrease in depressive symptoms and an improvement in memory functioning. Interpretation(s): These findings, although preliminary, support the use of DBS in AN, pointing to its safety, even for cognitive functioning; improvements of cognitive flexibility are reported. DBS seems to exert changes on cognition and mood that accompany BMI increments.

Deep Brain Stimulation of the Nucleus Accumbens in Severe Enduring Anorexia Nervosa: A Pilot Study,Scaife J.C.; Eraifej J.; Green A.L.; Petric B.; Aziz T.Z.; Park R.J. ,"Introduction: Anorexia nervosa (AN) is one of the most debilitating psychiatric disorders, becoming severe and enduring in a third of cases; with few effective treatments. Deep brain stimulation is a reversible, adjustable neurosurgical procedure that has been gaining ground in psychiatry as a treatment for depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder, yet few studies have investigated AN. Abnormal eating behavior and the compulsive pursuit of thinness in AN is, in part, a consequence of dysfunction in reward circuitry and the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) is central to reward processing. Method(s): Phase 1 prospective open-label pilot study of seven individuals with severe enduring AN. Electrodes were implanted bilaterally into the NAcc with stimulation at the anterior limb of the internal capsule using rechargeable implantable pulse generators. The protocol of 15 months included 12 months of deep brain stimulation incorporating two consecutive, randomized blind on-off fortnights 9 months after stimulation onset. The primary objectives were to investigate safety and feasibility, together with changes in eating disorder psychopathology. Result(s): Feasibility and safety was demonstrated with no serious adverse events due to deep brain stimulation. Three patients responded to treatment [defined as > 35% reduction in Eating Disorders Examination (EDE) score at 12 months] and four patients were non-responders. Responders had a statistically significant mean reduction in EDE scores (50.3% reduction; 95% CI 2.6-98.2%), Clinical Impairment Assessment (45.6% reduction; 95% CI 7.4-83.7%). Responders also had a statistically significant mean reduction in Hamilton Depression Scale, Hamilton Anxiety Scale and Snaith-Hamilton pleasure scale. There were no statistically significant changes in Body Mass Index, Yale-Brown-Cornell Eating Disorder Scale, Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale and World Health Organization Quality of Life Psychological subscale. Conclusion(s): This study provides some preliminary indication that deep brain stimulation to the NAcc. Might potentially improve some key features of enduring AN. In this small study, the three responders had comorbid obsessive-compulsive disorder which predated AN diagnosis. Future studies should aim to further elucidate predictors of outcome.

A Longitudinal Magnetoencephalographic Study of the Effects of Deep Brain Stimulation on Neuronal Dynamics in Severe Anorexia Nervosa,Braeutigam S.; Scaife J.C.; Aziz T.; Park R.J. ,"Anorexia Nervosa (AN) is a debilitating psychiatric disorder characterized by the relentless pursuit of thinness, leading to severe emaciation. Magnetoencephalography (MEG)was used to record the neuronal response in seven patients with treatment-resistant AN while completing a disorder-relevant food wanting task. The patients underwent a 15-month protocol, where MEG scans were conducted pre-operatively, post-operatively prior to deep brain stimulation (DBS) switch on, twice during a blind on/off month and at protocol end. Electrodes were implanted bilaterally into the nucleus accumbens with stimulation at the anterior limb of the internal capsule using rechargeable implantable pulse generators. Three patients met criteria as responders at 12 months of stimulation, showing reductions of eating disorder psychopathology of over 35%. An increase in alpha power, as well as evoked power at latencies typically associated with visual processing, working memory, and contextual integration was observed in ON compared to OFF sessions across all seven patients. Moreover, an increase in evoked power at P600-like latencies as well as an increase in gamma-band phase-locking over anterior-to-posterior regions were observed for high- compared to low-calorie food image only in ON sessions. These findings indicate that DBS modulates neuronal process in regions far outside the stimulation target site and at latencies possibly reflecting task specific processing, thereby providing further evidence that deep brain stimulation can play a role in the treatment of otherwise intractable psychiatric disorders.Copyright © 2022 Braeutigam, Scaife, Aziz and Park.",2022,/,Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience,16,"(Braeutigam) Oxford Centre for Human Brain Activity, Medical Sciences Division, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom(Braeutigam) Wellcome Centre For Integrative Neuroimaging, Medical Sciences Division, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom(",841843,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnbeh.2022.841843,2017815259,#914,Braeutigam 2022,"",anorexia
Role of deep brain stimulation in management of psychiatric disorders,Messina G.; Vetrano I.G.; Bonomo G.; Broggi G. ,"Nowadays, most of patients affected by psychiatric disorders are successfully treated with conservative therapies. Still, a variable percentage of them demonstrate resistance to conventional treatments, and alternative methods can then be considered. During the last 20 years, there is a progressive interest in use of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in mental illnesses. It has become clear nowadays, that this modality may be effectively applied under specific indications in some patients with major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, anorexia nervosa and other eating disorders, Tourette syndrome, schizophrenia, substance use disorder, and even pathologically aggressive behavior. Despite the fact that the efficacy of neuromodulation with DBS, as well as of various lesional interventions, in cases of mental illnesses is still not fully established, there are several premises for wider applications of such ""unclassical"" psychiatric treatments in the future. Novel technologies of DBS, developments in non-invasive lesioning using stereotactic radiosurgery and transcranial magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound, and advances of neurophysiological and neuroimaging modalities may bolster further clinical applications of psychiatric neurosurgery, improve its results, and allow for individually selected treatment strategies tailored to specific needs of the patient.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",2022,/,"Neurosurgical Management of Psychiatric Disorders, Part AProgress in Brain Research",270,1,61-96,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/bs.pbr.2022.01.026,2016884116,#916,Messina 2022,"",anorexia; non_specific; obesity; rev
Modern neurosurgical techniques for psychiatric disorders,De Salles A.; Lucena L.; Paranhos T.; Ferragut M.A.; de Oliveira-Souza R.; Gorgulho A. ,"Psychosurgery refers to an ensemble of more or less invasive techniques designed to reduce the burden caused by psychiatric diseases in patients who have failed to respond to conventional therapy. While most surgeries are designed to correct apparent anatomical abnormalities, no discrete cerebral anatomical lesion is evident in most psychiatric diseases amenable to invasive interventions. Finding the optimal surgical targets in mental illness is troublesome. In general, contemporary psychosurgical procedures can be classified into one of two primary modalities: lesioning and stimulation procedures. The first group is divided into (a) thermocoagulation and (b) stereotactic radiosurgery or recently introduced transcranial magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound, whereas stimulation techniques mainly include deep brain stimulation (DBS), cortical stimulation, and the vagus nerve stimulation. The most studied psychiatric diseases amenable to psychosurgical interventions are severe treatment-resistant major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, Tourette syndrome, anorexia nervosa, schizophrenia, and substance use disorder. Furthermore, modern neuroimaging techniques spurred the interest of clinicians to identify cerebral regions amenable to be manipulated to control psychiatric symptoms.

Deep brain stimulation for psychiatric disorders and behavioral/cognitive-related indications: Review of the literature and implications for treatment,Mahoney J.J.; Koch-Gallup N.; Scarisbrick D.M.; Berry J.H.; Rezai A.R. ,"While pharmacological and/or behavioral treatments are effective in managing symptoms for many patients with psychiatric diagnoses and disorders with behavioral/cognitive manifestations, a subset of individuals are treatment-refractory, unable to achieve appreciable benefit or symptom relief from traditional methods. In recent years, neuromodulation has gained momentum as an adjunctive treatment for improving outcomes in patients who are treatment-refractory. One form of neuromodulation, deep brain stimulation (DBS), has been investigated for the treatment of various psychiatric disorders and behavioral/cognitive symptoms. The following article provides a review of DBS investigations for several psychiatric and behavioral-related disorders, including depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, substance use disorder, Alzheimer's disease, anorexia, obesity, schizophrenia, and posttraumatic stress disorder. PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, Ovid MEDLINE, and Web of Science were used to identify published articles, and Clinicaltrials.gov was used to identify currently ongoing or planned studies. Findings revealed the potential utility of DBS in improving outcomes for various psychiatric and behavioral/cognitive-related disorders. While promising, there are several limitations present in the available literature, and further well-designed clinical trials are necessary before conclusive decisions regarding the utility of DBS for the treatment of these psychiatric/behavioral/cognitive-related disorders can be made. Regardless, the studies included in this review demonstrate positive preliminary findings for the potential benefit of DBS for treatment of a variety of psychiatric disorders, and further research is warranted to better determine the potential utility of DBS for those who are treatment-refractory and unable to achieve symptom relief with standard care.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",2022,/,Journal of the Neurological Sciences,437,"(Mahoney, Scarisbrick, Berry) WVU Department of Behavioral Medicine and Psychiatry, West Virginia University School of Medicine, Rockefeller Neuroscience Institute, Morgantown, WV 26505, United States(Mahoney, Koch-Gallup, Scarisbrick, Berry) WVU Departme",120253,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2022.120253,2017764785,#921,Mahoney 2022,"",anorexia; non_specific; obesity; rev

Probabilistic Mapping of Deep Brain Stimulation: Insights from 15 Years of Therapy,Elias G.J.B.; Boutet A.; Joel S.E.; Germann J.; Gwun D.; Neudorfer C.; Gramer R.M.; Algarni M.; Paramanandam V.; Prasad S.; Beyn M.E.; Horn A.; Madhavan R.; Ranjan M.; Lozano C.S.; Kuhn A.A.; Ashe J.; Kucharczyk W.; Munhoz R.P.; Giacobbe P.; Kennedy S.H.; Woodside D.B.; Kalia S.K.; Fasano A.; Hodaie M.; Lozano A.M. ,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) depends on precise delivery of electrical current to target tissues. However, the specific brain structures responsible for best outcome are still debated. We applied probabilistic stimulation mapping to a retrospective, multidisorder DBS dataset assembled over 15 years at our institution (ntotal = 482 patients; nParkinson disease = 303; ndystonia = 64; ntremor = 39; ntreatment-resistant depression/anorexia nervosa = 76) to identify the neuroanatomical substrates of optimal clinical response. Using high-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging and activation volume modeling, probabilistic stimulation maps (PSMs) that delineated areas of above-mean and below-mean response for each patient cohort were generated and defined in terms of their relationships with surrounding anatomical structures. Our results show that overlap between PSMs and individual patients' activation volumes can serve as a guide to predict clinical outcomes, but that this is not the sole determinant of response. In the future, individualized models that incorporate advancements in mapping techniques with patient-specific clinical variables will likely contribute to the optimization of DBS target selection and improved outcomes for patients.

"A randomized trial of deep brain stimulation to the subcallosal cingulate and nucleus accumbens in patients with treatment-refractory, chronic, and severe anorexia nervosa: Initial results at 6 months of follow up",Martinez G.V.; Justicia A.; Salgado P.; Gines J.M.; Guardiola R.; Cedron C.; Polo M.; Delgado-Martinez I.; Medrano S.; Manero R.M.; Conesa G.; Faus G.; Grau A.; Elices M.; Perez V. ,"Background: The main objective of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in patients with severe anorexia nervosa (AN). Method(s): Eight participants received active DBS to the subcallosal cingulate (SCC) or nucleus accumbens (NAcc) depending on comorbidities (affective or anxiety disorders, respectively) and type of AN. The primary outcome measure was body mass index (BMI). Result(s): Overall, we found no significant difference (p = 0.84) between mean preoperative and postoperative (month 6) BMI. A BMI reference value (BMI-RV) was calculated. In patients that received preoperative inpatient care to raise the BMI, the BMI-RV was defined as the mean BMI value in the 12 months prior to surgery. In patients that did not require inpatient care, the BMI-RV was defined as the mean BMI in the 3-month period before surgery. This value was compared to the postoperative BMI (month 6), revealing a significant increase (p = 0.02). After 6 months of DBS, five participants showed an increase of >=10% in the BMI-RV. Quality of life was improved (p = 0.03). Three cases presented cutaneous complications. Conclusion(s): DBS may be effective for some patients with severe AN. Cutaneous complications were observed.

Impressive weight gain after deep brain stimulation of nucleus accumbens in treatment-resistant bulimic anorexia nervosa,Arroteia I.F.; Husch A.; Baniasadi M.; Hertel F. ,"Anorexia nervosa (AN) severely impacts individual's mental and physical health as well as quality of life. In 21% of cases no durable response to conservative treatment can be obtained. The serious course of the disease in the most severely affected patients justifies invasive treatment options. One of the treatment methods increasingly used in recent years is deep brain stimulation (DBS). A 42-year-old woman suffering from chronic AN of the bulimic subtype shows a 46.9% weight gain and a subjective increase in quality of life, 12 months after bilateral nucleus accumbens (NAcc) DBS implantation. No improvement in comorbid depression could be achieved.

Deep brain stimulation of the nucleus accumbens for treatment-refractory anorexia nervosa: A long-term follow-up study,Liu W.; Zhan S.; Li D.; Lin Z.; Zhang C.; Wang T.; Pan S.; Zhang J.; Cao C.; Jin H.; Li Y.; Sun B. ,"Background: Given that anorexia nervosa (AN) is a life-threatening mental disorder and has poor clinical outcomes, novel effective treatments are warranted, especially for severe and persistent cases. Objective(s): To investigate the safety, feasibility, and clinical outcomes of using deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) in treatment-refractory AN patients. Method(s): A total of 28 women with refractory AN underwent NAcc-DBS and completed this 2-year follow-up study. The clinical outcomes, including body mass index (BMI) and mood, anxiety, and obsessive symptoms, were assessed using a series of psychiatric scales at 6 and 24 months post operation. Result(s): While no fatalities were reported during this study, 1 patient showed device rejection. The most common short-term side effect observed was varying degrees of pain at the incision sites (n = 22), which usually disappeared 3-4 days following the operation. No severe surgical adverse events were observed. Compared to presurgical levels, significant increases in BMI and improvement in psychiatric scale scores were noted during the 6-month follow-up and were maintained at the 2-year review. Finally, a post-hoc analysis revealed that the NAcc-DBS was less effective for weight restoration in patients with the binge-eating/purge subtype of AN than in those with the restricting subtype (R-AN). Conclusion(s): Our long-term follow-up study suggests that NAcc-DBS is safe and effective for improving the BMI and psychiatric symptoms of patients with refractory AN. Although NAcc-DBS appears to be more suitable for patients with R-AN, strict inclusion criteria must be applied considering surgery-related complications.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)",2020,/,Brain Stimulation,13,3,643-649,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.brs.2020.02.004,2004917943,#990,Liu 2020,"",anorexia
Changes in eating behavior after deep brain stimulation for anorexia nervosa.

Method(s): Bilateral DBS of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis was performed in a 37-year-old woman affected by refractory AN. Pre- and post-surgical evaluations were conducted via an array of validated testing instruments, which took into account the weight variations, body image concerns, eating behavior, quality of life, and nutritional status. Result(s): Overall, eating behavior-, body image concern-, and nutritional status-related testing instruments demonstrated improvements starting from the first post-operative month. Normal body weight was restored after 4 months of stimulation. Discussion(s): Only a few cases of DBS for AN have been conducted to determine the efficacy of surgery based upon weight variation and psychometric scales for anxiety and affective disorders.

It has proven to be efficacious and safe in the treatment of neurological disorders, mainly Parkinson's disease (PD), dystonia and essential tremor. DBS has very often contributed to successful treatment in cases that had proved resistant to all other methods of treatment. Nowadays treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is the main psychiatric indication for DBS. Many studies have focused on assessing the efficacy and safety of this method in different mental disorders, including depressive disorders, Alzheimer's disease, anorexia nervosa, Tourette syndrome, substance addiction or aggressive behaviors. Single cases of successful treatment in bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and post traumatic stress disorder have also emerged in recent years.

Deep Brain Stimulation of the Hypothalamus Leads to Increased Metabolic Rate in Refractory Obesity,Whiting A.C.; Sutton E.F.; Walker C.T.; Godzik J.; Catapano J.S.; Oh M.Y.; Tomycz N.D.; Ravussin E.; Whiting D.M. ,"Objective: Obesity has become a worldwide epidemic, with very few long-term successful treatment options for refractory disease. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the bilateral lateral hypothalamus (LH) in refractory obesity has been performed safely. However, questions remain regarding the optimal settings and its effects on metabolic rate. The goals of our experiment were to determine the optimal DBS settings and the actual effect of optimal stimulation on energy expenditure. Method(s): After bilateral LH DBS implantation, 2 subjects with treatment refractory obesity underwent 4 days of metabolic testing. The subjects slept overnight in a respiratory chamber to measure their baseline sleep energy expenditure, followed by 4 consecutive days of resting metabolic rate (RMR) testing at different stimulation settings. On day 4, the optimized DBS settings were used, and sleep energy expenditure was measured again overnight in the room calorimeter. Result(s): During daily testing, the RMR fluctuated acutely with changes in stimulation settings and returned to baseline immediately after turning off the stimulation. Optimal stimulation settings selected for participants showed a 20% and 16% increase in RMR for the 2 participants. Overnight sleep energy expenditure measurements at these optimized settings on day 4 yielded a 10.4% and 4.8% increase over the baseline measurements for the 2 participants. Conclusion(s): These findings have demonstrated the efficacy of optimized DBS of the LH on increasing the RMR acutely and maintaining this increase during overnight sleep.

An Open-Label Clinical Trial of Hypothalamic Deep Brain Stimulation for Human Morbid Obesity: BLESS Study Protocol,De Salles A.A.F.; Barbosa D.A.N.; Fernandes F.; Abucham J.; Nazato D.M.; Oliveira J.D.; Cury A.; Biasi A.; Rossi R.; Lasagno C.; Bueno P.T.; Santos R.H.N.; Damiani L.P.; Gorgulho A.A. ,"BACKGROUND: Human morbid obesity is increasing worldwide in an alarming way. The hypothalamus is known to mediate its mechanisms. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) may be an alternative to treat patients refractory to standard medical and surgical therapies. OBJECTIVE(S): To assess the safety, identify possible side effects, and to optimize stimulation parameters of continuous VMH-DBS. Additionally, this study aims to determine if continuous VMH-DBS will lead to weight loss by causing changes in body composition, basal metabolism, or food intake control. METHOD(S): The BLESS study is a feasibility study, single-center open-label trial. Six patients (body mass index > 40) will undergo low-frequency VMH-DBS. Data concerning timing, duration, frequency, severity, causal relationships, and associated electrical stimulation patterns regarding side effects or weight changes will be recorded. EXPECTED OUTCOMES: We expect to demonstrate the safety, identify possible side effects, and to optimize electrophysiological parameters related to VMH-DBS. No clinical or behavioral adverse changes are expected. Weight loss >= 3% of the basal weight after 3 mo of electrical stimulation will be considered adequate. Changes in body composition and increase in basal metabolism are expected. The amount of food intake is likely to remain unchanged. DISCUSSION: The design of this study protocol is to define the safety of the procedure, the surgical parameters important for target localization, and additionally the safety of long-term stimulation of the VMH in morbidly obese patients.

Invasive and non-invasive stimulation of the obese human brain,Pleger B. ,"Accumulating evidence suggests that non-invasive and invasive brain stimulation may reduce food craving and calorie consumption rendering these techniques potential treatment options for obesity. Non-invasive transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) or repetitive transcranial magnet stimulation (rTMS) are used to modulate activity in superficially located executive control regions, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Modulation of the DLPFC's activity may alter executive functioning and food reward processing in interconnected dopamine-rich regions such as the striatum or orbitofrontal cortex. Modulation of reward processing can also be achieved by invasive deep brain stimulation (DBS) targeting the nucleus accumbens. Another target for DBS is the lateral hypothalamic area potentially leading to improved energy expenditure. To date, available evidence is, however, restricted to few exceptional cases of morbid obesity. The vagal nerve plays a crucial role in signaling the homeostatic demand to the brain. Invasive or non-invasive vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) is thus assumed to reduce appetite, rendering VNS another possible treatment option for obesity. Based on currently available evidence, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently approved VNS for the treatment of obesity. This review summarizes scientific evidence regarding these techniques' efficacy in modulating food craving and calorie intake. It is time for large controlled clinical trials that are necessary to translate currently available research discoveries into patient care.Copyright © 2007 - 2018 Frontiers Media S.A.",2018,/,Frontiers in Neuroscience,12,NOV,884,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2018.00884,625303438,#1022,Pleger 2018,"",non_specific; obesity; rev

Patients with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) present with obesity that is often difficult to treat. Objective(s): To test the safety and study the outcome of DBS in patients with PWS. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This case series was conducted in the Hospital das Clinicas, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Four patients with genetically confirmed PWS presenting with severe obesity were included. Exposure: Deep brain stimulation electrodes were bilaterally implanted in the lateral hypothalamic area. After DBS implantation, the treatment included the following phases: titration (1-2 months), stimulation off (2 months), low-frequency DBS (40 Hz; 1 month), washout (15 days), high-frequency DBS (130 Hz; 1 month), and long-term follow-up (6 months). Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome measures were adverse events recorded during stimulation and long-term DBS treatment. Secondary outcomes consisted of changes in anthropometric measures (weight, body mass index [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared], and abdominal and neck circumference), bioimpedanciometry, and calorimetry after 6 months of treatment compared with baseline. The following evaluations and measurements were conducted before and after DBS: clinical, neurological, psychiatric, neuropsychological, anthropometry, calorimetry, blood workup, hormonal levels, and sleep studies. Adverse effects were monitored during all follow-up visits. Result(s): Four patients with PWS were included (2 male and 2 female; ages 18-28 years). Baseline mean (SD) body mass index was 39.6 (11.1). Two patients had previous bariatric surgery, and all presented with psychiatric comorbidity, which was well controlled with the use of medications. At 6 months after long-term DBS, patients had a mean 9.6% increase in weight, 5.8% increase in body mass index, 8.4% increase in abdominal circumference, 4.2% increase in neck circumference, 5.3% increase in the percentage of body fat, and 0% change in calorimetry compared with baseline. Also unchanged were hormonal levels and results of blood workup, sleep studies, and neuropsychological evaluations. Two patients developed stimulation-induced manic symptoms. Discontinuation of DBS controlled this symptom in 1 patient. The other required adjustments in medication dosage. Two infections were documented, 1 associated with skin picking.

Deep brain stimulation of the subcallosal cingulate for treatment-refractory anorexia nervosa: 1 year follow-up of an open-label trial,Lipsman N.; Lam E.; Volpini M.; Sutandar K.; Twose R.; Giacobbe P.; Sodums D.J.; Smith G.S.; Woodside D.B.; Lozano A.M. ,"Background Anorexia nervosa is a life-threatening illness. Brain circuits believed to drive anorexia nervosa symptoms can be accessed with surgical techniques such as deep brain stimulation (DBS). Initial results suggest that DBS of the subcallosal cingulate is safe and associated with improvements in mood and anxiety. Here, we investigated the safety, clinical, and neuroimaging outcomes of DBS of the subcallosal cingulate in a group of patients during 12 months of active stimulation. Methods We did this prospective open-label trial at the Department of Surgery of the University of Toronto (Toronto, ON, Canada). Patients were eligible to participate if they were aged 20-60 years and had a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa (restricting or binge-purging subtype) and a demonstrated history of chronicity or treatment resistance. Following a period of medical stabilisation, patients underwent surgery for DBS and received open-label continuous stimulation for the entire 1 year study duration. The primary outcome was safety and acceptability of the procedure. The secondary outcomes were body-mass index (BMI), mood, anxiety, affective regulation, and anorexia nervosa-specific behaviours at 12 months after surgery, as well as changes in neural circuitry (measured with PET imaging of cerebral glucose metabolism at baseline and at 6 and 12 months after surgery). This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01476540. Findings 16 patients with treatment-refractory anorexia nervosa were enrolled between September, 2011, and January, 2014, and underwent DBS of the subcallosal cingulate between November, 2011, and April, 2014. Patients had a mean age of 34 years (SD 8) and average illness duration of 18 years (SD 6). Two patients requested that their devices be removed or deactivated during the study, although their reasons for doing so were poorly defined. The most common adverse event was pain related to surgical incision or positioning that required oral analgesics for longer than 3-4 days after surgery (five [31%] of 16 patients). Seven (44%) of 16 patients had serious adverse events, most of which were related to the underlying illness, including electrolyte disturbances. Average BMI at surgery was 13.83 (SD 1.49) and 14 (88%) of the 16 patients had comorbid mood disorders, anxiety disorders, or both. Mean BMI after 12 months of stimulation was 17.34 (SD 3.40; p=0.0009 vs baseline). DBS was associated with significant improvements in measures of depression (mean Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores 19.40 [SD 6.76] at baseline vs 8.79 [7.64] at 12 months; p=0.00015), anxiety (mean Beck Anxiety Inventory score 38.00 [15.55] vs 27.14 [18.39]; p=0.035), and affective regulation (mean Dysfunction in Emotional Regulation Scale score 131.80 [22.04] vs 104.36 [31.27]; p=0.019). We detected significant changes in cerebral glucose metabolism in key anorexia nervosa-related structures at both 6 months and 12 months of ongoing brain stimulation. Interpretation In patients with chronic treatment-refractory anorexia nervosa, DBS is well tolerated and is associated with significant and sustained improvements in affective symptoms, BMI, and changes in neural circuitry at 12 months after surgery.

During hunger, exposure to food-related cues induced an increase in beta/low-gamma activity. In contrast, recordings during satiety were marked by prominent alpha rhythms. Based on these findings, we have delivered alpha-frequency DBS prior to and during food intake. Despite reporting an early sensation of fullness, the patient continued to crave food. This suggests that the pattern of activity in LHA may indicate hunger/satiety states in humans but attest to the complexity of conducting neuromodulation studies in obesity.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

Neuroimaging and neuromodulation approaches to study eating behavior and prevent and treat eating disorders and obesity,Val-Laillet D.; Aarts E.; Weber B.; Ferrari M.; Quaresima V.; Stoeckel L.E.; Alonso-Alonso M.; Audette M.; Malbert C.H.; Stice E. ,"Functional, molecular and genetic neuroimaging has highlighted the existence of brain anomalies and neural vulnerability factors related to obesity and eating disorders such as binge eating or anorexia nervosa. In particular, decreased basal metabolism in the prefrontal cortex and striatum as well as dopaminergic alterations have been described in obese subjects, in parallel with increased activation of reward brain areas in response to palatable food cues. Elevated reward region responsivity may trigger food craving and predict future weight gain. This opens the way to prevention studies using functional and molecular neuroimaging to perform early diagnostics and to phenotype subjects at risk by exploring different neurobehavioral dimensions of the food choices and motivation processes. In the first part of this review, advantages and limitations of neuroimaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), pharmacogenetic fMRI and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) will be discussed in the context of recent work dealing with eating behavior, with a particular focus on obesity. In the second part of the review, non-invasive strategies to modulate food-related brain processes and functions will be presented. At the leading edge of non-invasive brain-based technologies is real-time fMRI (rtfMRI) neurofeedback, which is a powerful tool to better understand the complexity of human brain-behavior relationships. rtfMRI, alone or when combined with other techniques and tools such as EEG and cognitive therapy, could be used to alter neural plasticity and learned behavior to optimize and/or restore healthy cognition and eating behavior. Other promising non-invasive neuromodulation approaches being explored are repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS). Converging evidence points at the value of these non-invasive neuromodulation strategies to study basic mechanisms underlying eating behavior and to treat its disorders. Both of these approaches will be compared in light of recent work in this field, while addressing technical and practical questions. The third part of this review will be dedicated to invasive neuromodulation strategies, such as vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) and deep brain stimulation (DBS). In combination with neuroimaging approaches, these techniques are promising experimental tools to unravel the intricate relationships between homeostatic and hedonic brain circuits. Their potential as additional therapeutic tools to combat pharmacorefractory morbid obesity or acute eating disorders will be discussed, in terms of technical challenges, applicability and ethics. In a general discussion, we will put the brain at the core of fundamental research, prevention and therapy in the context of obesity and eating disorders. First, we will discuss the possibility to identify new biological markers of brain functions. Second, we will highlight the potential of neuroimaging and neuromodulation in individualized medicine. Third, we will introduce the ethical questions that are concomitant to the emergence of new neuromodulation therapies.Copyright © 2015 The Authors.

The change in cerebral glucose metabolism after electroacupuncture: A possible marker to predict the therapeutic effect of deep brain stimulation for refractory anorexia nervosa,Liu T.-T.; Hong Q.-X.; Xiang H.-B. ,"Some reports have demonstrated that deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a promising treatment for patients who suffer from intractable anorexia nervosa. However, the nature of DBS may not be viewed as a standard clinical treatment option for anorexia nervosa because of the unpredictable outcome before DBS. Just like DBS in the brain, electroacupuncture at acupoints is also efficient in treating refractory anorexia nervosa. Some neuroimaging stud-ies using functional magnetic resonance imaging, single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and posi-tron emission tomography (PET) had revealed that both DBS and electroacupuncture at acupoints with electrical stimulation are related to the changes in cerebral glucose metabolism. Therefore, we hypothesize that the changes in cerebral glucose metabolism after electroacupuncture might be useful to predict the therapeutic effect of deep brain stimulation for refractory anorexia nervosa.Copyright © 2015, E-Century Publishing Corporation.

"Deep brain stimulation for addiction, anorexia and compulsion. Rationale, clinical results and ethical implications",Bartsch C.; Kuhn J. ,"Background. As an established treatment for movement disorders, the application of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for psychiatric indications has been investigated for almost 15 years. A CE label (also FDA approval) has recently been obtained for treatment of refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Objectives. This article aims at illustrating the current state of DBS in the treatment of refractory OCD. In addition, initial experimental approaches to investigate the potential use of DBS in substance addiction and anorexia nervosa (AN) will also be outlined as both disorders share some common features with OCD. Materials and methods. The present review is based on a keyword literature search (PubMed) while taking into account relevant references and own investigations Although the number of clinical trials for treatment of refractory OCD is limited and sample sizes are small, there is some evidence for a substantial improvement, a so-called full response of OCD symptoms under DBS. However, not all patients benefit from the intervention. Regarding substance addiction and AN, data are scarce and are only indicative of a potential benefit at most. Discussion. Present data regarding the clinical benefits of DBS in OCD are encouraging and open up new avenues for the treatment of therapy refractory patients. However, several aspects, such as mechanisms of action, predictors and long-term side effect profiles, are incomplete or even unknown. In the case of addiction and AN, DBS remains purely experimental, at least for the moment. Hence, clinical trials should remain the gold standard for all three indications. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.",2014,/,Nervenarzt,85,2,162-168,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00115-013-3879-4,52976016,#1107,Bartsch 2014,"",anorexia; rev

Subcallosal cingulate deep brain stimulation for treatment-refractory anorexia nervosa: A phase 1 pilot trial,Lipsman N.; Woodside D.B.; Giacobbe P.; Hamani C.; Carter J.C.; Norwood S.J.; Sutandar K.; Staab R.; Elias G.; Lyman C.H.; Smith G.S.; Lozano A.M. ,"Background Anorexia nervosa is characterised by a chronic course that is refractory to treatment in many patients and has one of the highest mortality rates of any psychiatric disorder. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been applied to circuit-based neuropsychiatric diseases, such as Parkinson's disease and major depression, with promising results. We aimed to assess the safety of DBS to modulate the activity of limbic circuits and to examine how this might aff ect the clinical features of anorexia nervosa. Methods We did a phase 1, prospective trial of subcallosal cingulate DBS in six patients with chronic, severe, and treatment-refractory anorexia nervosa. Eligible patients were aged 20-60 years, had been diagnosed with restricting or binge-purging anorexia nervosa, and showed evidence of chronicity or treatment resistance. Patients underwent medical optimisation preoperatively and had baseline body-mass index (BMI), psychometric, and neuroimaging investigations, followed by implantation of electrodes and pulse generators for continuous delivery of electrical stimulation. Patients were followed up for 9 months after DBS activation, and the primary outcome of adverse events associated with surgery or stimulation was monitored at every follow-up visit. Repeat psychometric assessments, BMI measurements, and neuroimaging investigations were also done at various intervals. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01476540. Findings DBS was associated with several adverse events, only one of which (seizure during programming, roughly 2 weeks after surgery) was serious. Other related adverse events were panic attack during surgery, nausea, air embolus, and pain. After 9 months, three of the six patients had achieved and maintained a BMI greater than their historical baselines. DBS was associated with improvements in mood, anxiety, aff ective regulation, and anorexia nervosa-related obsessions and compulsions in four patients and with improvements in quality of life in three patients after 6 months of stimulation. These clinical benefi ts were accompanied by changes in cerebral glucose metabolism (seen in a comparison of composite PET scans at baseline and 6 months) that were consistent with a reversal of the abnormalities seen in the anterior cingulate, insula, and parietal lobe in the disorder. Interpretation Subcallosal cingulate DBS seems to be generally safe in this sample of patients with chronic and treatment-refractory anorexia nervosa.",2013,/,The Lancet,381,9875,1361-1370,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736%2812%2962188-6,52475931,#1122,Lipsman 2013,"",anorexia
Metabolic imaging of deep brain stimulation in anorexia nervosa: A 18F-FDG PET/CT study,Zhang H.-W.; Li D.-Y.; Zhao J.; Guan Y.-H.; Sun B.-M.; Zuo C.-T. ,"OBJECTIVES: Anorexia nervosa (AN), a disorder of unknown etiology, has the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric disorder. Drawing the brain metabolic pattern of AN may help to target the core biological and psychological features of the disorder and to perfect the diagnosis and recovery criteria. In this study, we used F-FDG PET to show brain metabolic network for AN. METHOD(S): Glucose metabolism in 6 AN patients and 12 age-matched healthy controls was studied using F-FDG PET. SPM2 was used to compare brain metabolism in AN patients with that in healthy controls. Four of 6 AN patients took deep brain stimulation (DBS) targeted in nucleus accumbens (NAcc). About 3 to 6 months after the surgery, the 4 AN patients took another F-FDG PET scan to assess the change in brain glucose metabolism. RESULT(S): The SPM (statistical parametric mapping ) analysis showed hypermetabolism in the frontal lobe (bilateral, BA10, BA11, BA47), the limbic lobe (bilateral, hippocampus, and amygdala), lentiform nucleus (bilateral), left insula (BA13), and left subcallosal gyrus (BA25). It also showed hypometabolism in the parietal lobe (bilateral, BA7, BA40). The hypermetabolism in frontal lobe, hippocampus, and lentiform nucleus decreased after NAcc-DBS. CONCLUSION(S): The changes in brain glucose metabolism illustrated the brain metabolic pattern in AN patients. Furthermore, the pattern can be modulated by NAcc-DBS, which confirmed specificity of the pattern. The regions with altered metabolism could interconnect to form a network and integrate information related to appetite. Our study may provide information for targeting the potential candidate brain regions for understanding the pathophysiology of AN and assessing the effects of existing and future treatment approaches.

Stereotactic surgery for eating disorders,Sun B.; Liu W. ,"Eating disorders (EDs) are a group of severely impaired eating behaviors, which include three subgroups: anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), and ED not otherwise specified (EDNOS). The precise mechanism of EDs is still unclear and the disorders cause remarkable agony for the patients and their families. Although there are many available treatment methods for EDs today, such as family therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, medication, psychotherapy, and so on, almost half of the patients are refractory to all current medical treatment and never fully recover. For treatment-refractory EDs, stereotactic surgery may be an alternative therapy. This review discusses the history of stereotactic surgery, the modern procedures, and the mostly used targets of stereotactic surgery in EDs. In spite of the limited application of stereotactic surgery in ED nowadays, stereotactic lesion and deep brain stimulation (DBS) are promising treatments with the development of modern functional imaging techniques and the increasing understanding of its mechanism in the future. © 2013 Sun B.",2013,/,Surgical Neurology International,4,SUPPL.3,S164-S169,,https://dx.doi.org/10.4103/2152-7806.110668,368954536,#1136,Sun 2013,"",anorexia; non_specific; rev
Treatment of intractable anorexia nervosa with inactivation of the nucleus accumbens using stereotactic surgery,Wang J.; Chang C.; Geng N.; Wang X.; Gao G. ,"Background: For 30% of anorexia nervosa (AN) patients, conventional treatments are unsuccessful; this is termed intractable AN. Objective(s): This study investigates whether ablation of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) using stereotactic surgery can arouse the physiological drive to eat in intractable AN patients. Method(s): Eight patients with intractable AN were included: 6 patients underwent bilateral stereotactic radio frequency ablation in the NAc and 2 patients received bilateral NAc deep brain stimulation (DBS). Observations were made for basic vital signs, body mass index (BMI), menstruation, depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, personality, intelligence, memory, quality of life, social functioning, as well as complications and adverse events associated with the treatment. Result(s): Basic vital signs, BMI and menstruation had recovered 1 year after the operation. Depression, anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder were improved 1 year postoperatively. There were changes in personality scores for psychoticism, neuroticism and lie tendencies that seemed to be helpful to the recovery from AN. Intelligence and memory improved after 6 months postoperatively. Quality of life and social functioning were dramatically improved at 1 year postoperatively. Conclusion(s): The results of this study reveal that ablation of the NAc can increase the AN patients' physiological drive to eat. Furthermore, there were no severe and/or life-influencing complications associated with the treatment.Copyright © 2013 S.

"Lateral hypothalamic area deep brain stimulation for refractory obesity: A pilot study with preliminary data on safety, body weight, and energy metabolism: Clinical article",Whiting D.M.; Tomycz N.D.; Bailes J.; De Jonge L.; Lecoultre V.; Wilent B.; Alcindor D.; Prostko E.R.; Cheng B.C.; Angle C.; Cantella D.; Whiting B.B.; Mizes J.S.; Finnis K.W.; Ravussin E.; Oh M.Y. ,"Object. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) has been suggested as a potential treatment for intractable obesity. The authors present the 2-year safety results as well as early efficacy and metabolic effects in 3 patients undergoing bilateral LHA DBS in the first study of this approach in humans. Methods. Three patients meeting strict criteria for intractable obesity, including failed bariatric surgery, underwent bilateral implantation of LHA DBS electrodes as part of an institutional review board- and FDA-approved pilot study. The primary focus of the study was safety; however, the authors also received approval to collect data on early efficacy including weight change and energy metabolism. Results. No serious adverse effects, including detrimental psychological consequences, were observed with continuous LHA DBS after a mean follow-up of 35 months (range 30-39 months). Three-dimensional nonlinear transformation of postoperative imaging superimposed onto brain atlas anatomy was used to confirm and study DBS contact proximity to the LHA. No significant weight loss trends were seen when DBS was programmed using standard settings derived from movement disorder DBS surgery. However, promising weight loss trends have been observed when monopolar DBS stimulation has been applied via specific contacts found to increase the resting metabolic rate measured in a respiratory chamber. Conclusions. Deep brain stimulation of the LHA may be applied safely to humans with intractable obesity. Early evidence for some weight loss under metabolically optimized settings provides the first 'proof of principle' for this novel antiobesity strategy. A larger follow-up study focused on efficacy along with a more rigorous metabolic analysis is planned to further explore the benefits and therapeutic mechanism behind this investigational therapy. © AANS, 2013.",2013,/,Journal of Neurosurgery,119,1,56-63,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3171/2013.2.JNS12903,369278711,#1143,Whiting 2013,"",obesity

Evaluating the potential of deep brain stimulation for treatment-resistant anorexia nervosa,Lipsman N.; Woodside B.; Lozano A.M. ,"Anorexia nervosa is a chronic and debilitating psychiatric disorder associated with one of the highest mortality rates of any psychiatric condition. Despite advances in neuroimaging, genetics, pharmacology, and psychosocial interventions in the last half-century, little progress has been made in altering the natural history of the condition or its outcomes. Evidence is now emerging that the condition is, at least in part, maintained by dysfunctional activity in key neuroanatomic circuits subserving illness-maintaining symptoms. Abnormal reward processing, compulsive hyperactivity, chronic anxiety, and depression, all suggest that anorexia nervosa shares much in common with other conditions, such as major depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder, for which surgical therapy with deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been tried, with promising results. As a result, the use of DBS in treatment-resistant anorexia nervosa should be evaluated in carefully designed, early-phase feasibility trials. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",2013,/,Handbook of Clinical Neurology,116,"(Lipsman, Lozano) Division of Neurosurgery, Toronto Western Hospital, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada(Woodside) Department of Psychiatry, Toronto General Hospital, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada",271-276,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-444-53497-2.00022-X,1369981093,#1148,Lipsman 2013,"",anorexia; rev
