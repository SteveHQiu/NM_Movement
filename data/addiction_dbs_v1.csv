treatment response [m]","Background: Non-invasive brain stimulation methods for modulating brain activity via transcranial technologies like transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) are increasingly prevalent to investigate the relationship between modulated brain regions and stimulation outcomes. However, the interindividual variability of tDCS has made it challenging to detect intervention effects at the group level. Collecting multiple modalities of magnetic resonance imaging data (i.e., structural and functional MRI) helps to investigate how dose-response ultimately shapes brain function in response to tDCS. Method(s): We collected data in a randomized, triple-blind, sham-controlled trial with two parallel arms. Sixty participants with MUD were randomly assigned to sham or active tDCS (n=30 per group, 2 mA, 20 minutes, anode/cathode over F4/Fp1). Structural and functional MRI (including high-resolution T1 and T2-weighted MRI, resting-state fMRI, and methamphetamine cue-reactivity task with meth versus neutral cues) were collected immediately before and after tDCS. T1 and T2-weighted MRI data were used to generate head models for each individual to simulate electric fields. Associations between electric fields (dose) and changes in brain function (response) were investigated at four different levels: (1) voxel level, (2) regional level (atlas-based parcellation), (3) cluster level (active clusters in the contrast of interest), and (4) network level (both task-based and resting-state networks). Result(s): At the (1) voxel-level, (2) regional level, and (3) cluster level, our results showed no significant correlation between changes in the functional activity and electric fields. However, (4) at the network level, a significant negative correlation was found between the electric field and ReHo in the default mode network (r=-0.46 (medium effect size), p corrected=0.018). For the network-level analysis of task-based fMRI data, frontoparietal connectivity showed a positive significant correlation with the electric field in the frontal stimulation site (r=0.41 (medium effect size), p corrected=0.03). Conclusion(s): The proposed pipeline provides a methodological framework to analyze tDCS effects in terms of dose-response relationships at four different levels to directly link the electric field (dose) variability to the variability of the neural response to tDCS. The results suggest that network-based analysis might be a better approach to provide novel insights into the dependency of the neuromodulatory effects of tDCS on the brain's regional current dose in each individual. Dose-response integration can be informative for dose optimization/customization or predictive/treatment-response biomarker extraction in future brain stimulation studies.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Several brainstem nuclei have been identified as the primary central nervous system (CNS) source of important monoaminergic ascending fibers including the noradrenergic locus coeruleus, serotonergic dorsal raphe nucleus, and dopaminergic ventral tegmental area. However, due to practical challenges to their study, there is limited data regarding their in vivo anatomic connectivity in humans. Objective To evaluate the structural connectivity of the following brainstem nuclei with limbic cortical areas: locus coeruleus, ventral tegmental area, periaqueductal grey, dorsal raphe nucleus, and nucleus tractus solitarius. Additionally, to develop a group average atlas of these limbic brainstem structures to facilitate future analyses. Methods Each nucleus was manually masked from 197 Human Connectome Project (HCP) structural MRI images using FSL software. Probabilistic tractography was performed using FSL's FMRIB Diffusion Toolbox. Connectivity with limbic cortical regions was calculated and compared between brainstem nuclei. Results were aggregated to produce a freely available MNI structural atlas of limbic brainstem structures. Results A general trend was observed for a high probability of connectivity to the amygdala, hippocampus and DLPFC with relatively lower connectivity to the orbitofrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, hippocampus and insula. The locus coeruleus and nucleus tractus solitarius demonstrated significantly greater connectivity to the DLPFC than amygdala while the periaqueductal grey, dorsal raphe nucleus, and ventral tegmental area did not demonstrate a significant difference between these two structures. Conclusion Monoaminergic and other modulatory nuclei in the brainstem project widely to cortical limbic regions. We describe the structural connectivity across the several key brainstem nuclei theorized to influence emotion, reward, and cognitive functions. An increased understanding of the anatomic basis of the brainstem's role in emotion and other reward-related processing will support targeted neuromodulatary therapies aimed at alleviating the symptoms of neuropsychiatric disorders.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Understanding neural differences associated with tobacco use may help generate novel treatment options. Several animal studies have recently highlighted the central role of the thalamus in substance use disorders, but this research focus has been understudied in human smokers. Here, we investigated associations between structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging measures of the thalamus and its subnuclei to distinct smoking characteristics. We acquired anatomical scans of 32 smokers as well as functional resting-state scans before and after a cue-reactivity task. Thalamic functional connectivity was associated with craving and dependence severity, whereas the volume of the thalamus was associated with dependence severity only. Craving, which fluctuates rapidly, was best characterized by differences in brain function, whereas the rather persistent syndrome of dependence severity was associated with both brain structural differences and function. Our study supports the notion that functional versus structural measures tend to be associated with behavioral measures that evolve at faster versus slower temporal scales, respectively. It confirms the importance of the thalamus to understand mechanisms of addiction and highlights it as a potential target for brain-based interventions to support smoking cessation, such as brain stimulation and neurofeedback.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

We addressed this gap by interviewing those with SUDs. Method(s): Participants viewed a short video introducing DBS, followed by a 1.5 hour semi-structured interview on their experiences with SUDs and their perspective on DBS as a possible treatment option. Interviews were analyzed by multiple coders who iteratively identified salient themes. Result(s): We interviewed 20 people in 12-step based, inpatient treatment programs (10 [50%] white/Caucasian, 7 Black/African American [35%], 2 Asian [10%], 1 Hispanic/Latino [5%], and 1 [5%] Alaska Native/American Indian; 11 [45%] women). Interviewees described a variety of barriers they currently faced through the course of their disease that mirrored barriers often associated with DBS (stigma, invasiveness, maintenance burdens, privacy risks) and thus made them more open to the possibility of DBS as a future treatment option. Conclusion(s): Individuals with SUDs gave relatively less weight to surgical risks and clinical burdens associated with DBS than previous surveys of provider attitudes anticipated. These differences derived largely from their experiences living with an often-fatal disease and encountering limitations of current treatment options. These findings support the study of DBS as a treatment option for SUDs, with extensive input from people with SUDs and advocates.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Psychiatric surgery emerged from the incipient work of Moniz and Lima lesioning the prefrontal cortex in agitated patients. Since the onset of stereotactic and functional neurosurgery with Spiegel and Wycis, the treatment of mental diseases gave attention to refractory illnesses mainly with the use of thalamotomies. Neurosis and some psychotic symptoms were treated by them. Several indications when lesioning the brain were included: obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, and aggressiveness among others with a diversity of targets. The indiscriminately use of anatomical sites without enough scientific evidence, and uncertainly defined criteria for selecting patients merged with a deficiency in ethical aspects, brought a lack of procedures for a long time: only select clinics allowed this surgery around the world from 1950 to the 1990s. In 1999, Nuttin et al. began a new chapter in limbic surgery with the use of Deep Brain Stimulation, based on the experience of pain, Parkinson's disease, and epilepsy. The efforts were focused on different targets to treat depression and obsessive-compulsive disorders. Nevertheless, other diseases were added to use neuromodulation. The goal of this article is to show the new opportunities to treat neuropsychiatric diseases.Copyright © 2023 Carrillo-Ruiz, Carrillo-Marquez, Beltran, Jimenez-Ponce, Garcia-Munoz, Navarro-Olvera, Marquez-Franco and Velasco.",Frontiers in Neuroscience,2023

ventromedial prefrontal cortex","Substance use disorders (SUD) represent a significant public health issue with a high need for novel and efficacious treatment options. In light of this high unmet need, recent results reporting beneficial outcomes of psychedelic-assisted therapy in SUD are particularly relevant. However, several questions remain with regard to this treatment approach. The clinical mechanisms of action of psychedelic substances in the treatment of SUD are not well understood. Closing this knowledge gap is critical to inform and optimize the psychotherapeutic embedding of the acute substance administration. In this chapter, we discuss potential mechanisms that have implications on psychotherapeutic approaches including induced neuroplasticity, alterations in brain network connectivity, reward and emotion processing, social connectedness, insight, and mystical experiences. Furthermore, we outline considerations and approaches that leverage these mechanisms in order to optimize the therapeutic embedding by maximizing synergy between substance effects and psychotherapy. Understanding the mechanisms of action, developing psychotherapeutic approaches accordingly, and evaluating their synergistic efficacy in scientific studies will be critical to advance the framework of psychedelic-assisted therapy for addiction, create evidence-based approaches, and achieve the best treatment outcome for patients with SUD.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,2022

The present review explores a heuristic framework for understanding the role of anhedonia in addiction, in which anhedonia is a key component of hyperkatifeia (conceptualized as the potentiated intensity of negative emotional/motivational symptoms during drug withdrawal) and negative reinforcement in addiction. The neural substrates that mediate such anhedonia and crosstalk between elements of hyperkatifeia that contribute to anhedonia are then explored, including crosstalk between physical pain and emotional pain systems. The present review explores current knowledge of neurochemical neurocircuitry changes that are associated with conditioned hyperkatifeia/anhedonia. The overall hypothesis is that the shift in motivation toward negative reinforcement in addiction reflects the allostatic misregulation of hedonic tone, such that drug taking makes anhedonia worse during the process of seeking temporary relief by compulsive drug taking, thereby perpetuating the addiction cycle and hedonic comorbidities that are associated with addiction.Copyright © 2022, Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH.

Despite advances in behavioral and pharmacological treatments, over 50% of those receiving treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) experience drug use recurrence (relapse). Given the prevalence of OUD and other substance use disorders (SUDs), the high rate of drug use recurrence, and the number of drug overdose deaths, novel treatment strategies are desperately needed. The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and feasibility of deep brain stimulation (DBS) targeting the nucleus accumbens (NAc)/ventral capsule (VC) and potential impact on outcomes in individuals with treatment-refractory OUD. METHOD(S): A prospective, open-label, single-arm study was conducted among participants with longstanding treatment-refractory OUD (along with other co-occurring SUDs) who underwent DBS in the NAc/VC. The primary study endpoint was safety; secondary/exploratory outcomes included opioid and other substance use, substance craving, and emotional symptoms throughout follow-up and 18FDG-PET neuroimaging. RESULT(S): Four male participants were enrolled and all tolerated DBS surgery well with no serious adverse events (AEs) and no device- or stimulation-related AEs. Two participants sustained complete substance abstinence for > 1150 and > 520 days, respectively, with significant post-DBS reductions in substance craving, anxiety, and depression. One participant experienced post-DBS drug use recurrences with reduced frequency and severity. The DBS system was explanted in one participant due to noncompliance with treatment requirements and the study protocol. 18FDG-PET neuroimaging revealed increased glucose metabolism in the frontal regions for the participants with sustained abstinence only. CONCLUSION(S): DBS of the NAc/VC was safe, feasible, and can potentially reduce substance use, craving, and emotional symptoms in those with treatment-refractory OUD.

treatment response","Psychiatric comorbidity is the norm in the assessment and treatment of eating disorders (EDs), and traumatic events and lifetime PTSD are often major drivers of these challenging complexities. Given that trauma, PTSD, and psychiatric comorbidity significantly influence ED outcomes, it is imperative that these problems be appropriately addressed in ED practice guidelines. The presence of associated psychiatric comorbidity is noted in some but not all sets of existing guidelines, but they mostly do little to address the problem other than referring to independent guidelines for other disorders. This disconnect perpetuates a ""silo effect,"" in which each set of guidelines do not address the complexity of the other comorbidities. Although there are several published practice guidelines for the treatment of EDs, and likewise, there are several published practice guidelines for the treatment of PTSD, none of them specifically address ED + PTSD. The result is a lack of integration between ED and PTSD treatment providers, which often leads to fragmented, incomplete, uncoordinated and ineffective care of severely ill patients with ED + PTSD. This situation can inadvertently promote chronicity and multimorbidity and may be particularly relevant for patients treated in higher levels of care, where prevalence rates of concurrent PTSD reach as high as 50% with many more having subthreshold PTSD. Although there has been some progress in the recognition and treatment of ED + PTSD, recommendations for treating this common comorbidity remain undeveloped, particularly when there are other co-occurring psychiatric disorders, such as mood, anxiety, dissociative, substance use, impulse control, obsessive-compulsive, attention-deficit hyperactivity, and personality disorders, all of which may also be trauma-related. In this commentary, guidelines for assessing and treating patients with ED + PTSD and related comorbidity are critically reviewed. An integrated set of principles used in treatment planning of PTSD and trauma-related disorders is recommended in the context of intensive ED therapy. These principles and strategies are borrowed from several relevant evidence-based approaches. Evidence suggests that continuing with traditional single-disorder focused, sequential treatment models that do not prioritize integrated, trauma-focused treatment approaches are short-sighted and often inadvertently perpetuate this dangerous multimorbidity. Future ED practice guidelines would do well to address concurrent illness in more depth.Copyright © 2023 Brewerton.",Frontiers in Psychiatry,2023

Both invasive and noninvasive interventions that target brain micro- and macrocircuits and produce functional improvements have been developed. In this review, we critically evaluate the existing methods for brain augmentation and discuss specific aspects of brain circuitry and neuronal mechanisms that could be augmented. The review covers a range of approaches, including neuromodulation, pharmacological methods, brain-computer and brain-to-brain interfaces, and even lasers. We describe advances in neural technologies, such as microtechnology, spintronics, nanotechnology, optogenetics, and minimally invasive electrode arrays. These modern tools hold promise to translate to revolutionary treatments for devastating brain disorders. Given the potential impact of brain augmentation approaches on the society, it is also important to discuss the philosophical and ethical issues arising from the use of technologies to enhance neural processing of information, memory, attention, and emotions.Copyright © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,2021

Abuse of prescription drugs purported to offer nootropic potential is increasing, and new brands of over-the-counter nootropics are being developed. However, the majority of research into the effectiveness and safety of cognitive-enhancing substances has been performed on adults, and the prefrontal cortex, the brain region in control of higher-order cognitive function, does not finish developing until adulthood, raising concerns that adolescent abuse of cognitive enhancers could result in lasting changes to the brain. In this chapter, we discuss the current trends in cognitive enhancement among adolescents and adults, examine several prescription drugs commonly used or being examined for their potential cognitive-enhancing effects, and discuss the potential risks of each substance. We also discuss the state of over-the-counter nootropics and the lack of reliable research into their efficacy and safety.Copyright © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,2021

In this pilot study, we performed double blind cross-over trials, with ""ON-DBS"" vs. ""SHAM-DBS"" for 1-month periods. STN-DBS failed to reduce cocaine craving and use. An episode of DBS-induced hypomania occurred after several weeks of cocaine intake at stimulation parameters previously well tolerated.

Methods By searching through different databases that focused on withdrawn drugs due to their ADRs-related abuse effects between 1930 and 2021 that could provide findings of evidence used in making withdrawal decisions based on the tools of the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (OCEBM) criteria alongside sources derived from authorities based on their withdrawal. The outcomes were categorized, and the average time between the launch date of exposure and withdrawal was calculated and stratified. Key findings A total of 33 abused withdrawn drugs. The withdrawals occurred between 1961 and 2007. Psychostimulant drugs accounted for most of the abuse withdrawals (42.4%). Most of the withdrawals occurred between 1981 and 1990 (n = 18, 54.5%). Most withdrawn drugs were in Europe (41, 46.6%) with a minimum withdrawal period of 5 years and an average time of withdrawal of 28.8 years. Conclusions Psychostimulant drugs presented the most abuse withdrawals based on the evidence of case-control studies, and the most withdrawals were in Europe. The duration of withdrawn drugs was different from region to region in different continents. More intensive research is required to further reduce the time duration between drug marketing and withdrawal, which will help improve decision-making processes with favourable benefit-risk ratio outcomes.Copyright © The Author(s) 2022.

The attainment of abstinence is hindered by persistent maladaptive drug-associated memories, which drive drug-seeking and use behavior. This article examines the preliminary evidence supporting the combination of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques and memory editing (or reconsolidation) interventions as add-on forms of treatment for individuals with substance-related disorders (SUD). Studies have shown that NIBS can modestly reduce drug use and craving through improved cognitive control or other undetermined reasons. Memory reconsolidation, a process by which a previously consolidated memory trace can be made labile again, can potentially erase or significantly weaken SUD memories underpinning craving and the propensity for relapse. This approach conveys enthusiasm while also emphasizing the importance of managing boundary conditions and null results for interventions found on fear memory reconsolidation. Recent studies, which align with the state-dependency and activity-selectivity hypotheses, have shown that the combination of NIBS and behavioral interventions holds promise for treating SUD by reducing self-reported and physiological aspects of craving. Effective long-term outcomes for this procedure require better identification of critical memories, a deeper understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying SUD and memory reconsolidation and overcoming any boundary conditions of destabilized memories. This will enable the procedure to be personalized to the unique needs of individual patients.Copyright © 2023 Noel.",Frontiers in Psychiatry,2023

wellbeing","Substance use disorders (SUDs) are highly prevalent and exact a large toll on individuals' health, well-being, and social functioning. Long-lasting changes in brain networks involved in reward, executive function, stress reactivity, mood, and self-awareness underlie the intense drive to consume substances and the inability to control this urge in a person who suffers from addiction (moderate or severe SUD). Biological (including genetics and developmental life stages) and social (including adverse childhood experiences) determinants of health are recognized factors that contribute to vulnerability for or resilience against developing a SUD. Consequently, prevention strategies that target social risk factors can improve outcomes and, when deployed in childhood and adolescence, can decrease the risk for these disorders. SUDs are treatable, and evidence of clinically significant benefit exists for medications (in opioid, nicotine and alcohol use disorders), behavioral therapies (in all SUDs), and neuromodulation (in nicotine use disorder). Treatment of SUDs should be considered within the context of a Chronic Care Model, with the intensity of intervention adjusted to the severity of the disorder and with the concomitant treatment of comorbid psychiatric and physical conditions. Involvement of health care providers in detection and management of SUDs, including referral of severe cases to specialized care, offers sustainable models of care that can be further expanded with the use of telehealth. Despite advances in our understanding and management of SUDs, individuals with these conditions continue to be stigmatized and, in some countries, incarcerated, highlighting the need to dismantle policies that perpetuate their criminalization and instead develop policies to ensure support and access to prevention and treatment.Copyright © 2023 World Psychiatric Association.",World Psychiatry,Jun-23

whole brain radiotherapy","Nicotine dependence is a major predictor of relapse in people with Tobacco Use Disorder (TUD). Accordingly, therapies that reduce nicotine dependence may promote sustained abstinence from smoking. The insular cortex has been identified as a promising target in brain-based therapies for TUD, and has three major sub-regions (ventral anterior, dorsal anterior, and posterior) that serve distinct functional networks. How these subregions and associated networks contribute to nicotine dependence is not well understood, and therefore was the focus of this study. Sixty individuals (28 women; 18-45 years old), who smoked cigarettes daily, rated their level of nicotine dependence (on the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence) and, after abstaining from smoking overnight (~12 h), underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a resting state. A subset of these participants (N = 48) also completing a cue-induced craving task during fMRI. Correlations between nicotine dependence and resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) and cue-induced activation of the major insular sub-regions were evaluated. Nicotine dependence was negatively correlated with connectivity of the left and right dorsal, and left ventral anterior insula with regions within the superior parietal lobule (SPL), including the left precuneus. No relationship between posterior insula connectivity and nicotine dependence was found. Cue-induced activation in the left dorsal anterior insula was positively associated with nicotine dependence and negatively associated with RSFC of the same region with SPL, suggesting that craving-related responsivity in this subregion was greater among participants who were more dependent. These results may inform therapeutic approaches, such as brain stimulation, which may elicit differential clinical outcomes (e.g., dependence, craving) depending on the insular subnetwork that is targeted.Copyright © 2023, The Author(s).",Neuropsychopharmacology,May-23

Their sources have been localized to Heschl's gyri and to the supratemporal auditory cortices. Auditory evoked fields are known to be modulated by peripheral and central lesions of auditory pathways and to reflect group-level pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. They are useful in lateralization of language processes for planning neurosurgery and for localization of language-related cortex. The recently developed artifact rejection and movement compensation methods will enhance and extend the use of AEFs in studies of clinical patients and pediatric groups. New pediatric magnetoencephalography systems will facilitate clinical AEF studies of developmental disorders. In addition to their established use in planning neurosurgery, AEF findings in several new clinical patient groups suffering, e.g., from developmental, neurodegenerative, or psychiatric disorders have been reported. Several recent investigations report the correlations with clinical symptoms and sensitivity and specificity profiles of AEFs in studies of these disorders; this development is mandatory in gaining wider clinical approval for the use of AEFs in clinical practice dealing with individual patients. Most promising future research lines of clinical applicability of AEFs focus on developmental and psychiatric disorders.Copyright © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

A single-nucleotide polymorphism of the BDNF rs6265 gene may contribute to the pattern and magnitude of brain metabolite abnormalities apparent in those with an Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). We predicted that Methionine (Met) carriers would demonstrate lower magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) measures of N-acetylaspartate level (NAA) and greater age-related decline in NAA than Valine (Val) homozygotes. Method(s): Veterans with AUD (n=95; 46+/-12 years of age, min = 25, max = 71) were recruited from VA Palo Alto residential treatment centers. Single voxel MRS, at 3 Tesla, was used to obtain NAA, choline (Cho) and creatine (Cr) containing compounds from the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Metabolite spectra were fit with LC Model and NAA and Cho were standardized to total Cr level and NAA was also standardized to Cho. Result(s): Val/Met (n=35) showed markedly greater age-related decline in left DLPFC NAA/Cr level than Val/Val (n=60); no differences in mean metabolite levels were observed between Val/Met and Val/Val. Val/Met demonstrated greater frequency of history of MDD and higher frequency of cannabis use disorder over 12 months prior to study. Conclusion(s): The greater age-related decline in left DLPFC NAA/Cr and the higher frequency of MDD history and Cannabis Use disorder in BDNF rs6265 Met carriers with AUD are novel and may have implications for non-invasive brain stimulation targeting the left DLFPC and other psychosocial interventions typically utilized in the treatment of AUD.Copyright © 2023",Drug and Alcohol Dependence,01-Jul-23

visual analog scale","Gambling disorder (GD) is a behavioral addiction that severely impacts individuals' functioning, leading to high socioeconomic costs. Non-invasive brain stimulation (NiBS) has received attention for treating psychiatric and neurological conditions in recent decades, but there is no recommendation for its use for GD. Therefore, this study aimed to systematically review and analyze the available literature to determine the effectiveness of NiBS in treating GD. Following the PRISMA guidelines, we screened four electronic databases up to July 2022 and selected relevant English-written original articles. We included ten papers in the systematic review and seven in the meta-analysis. As only two studies employed a sham-controlled design, the pre-post standardized mean change (SMCC) was computed as effect size only for real stimulation. The results showed a significant effect of NiBS in reducing craving scores (SMCC = -0.69; 95% CI = [-1.2, -0.2], p = 0.010). Moreover, considering the GD's frequent comorbidity with mood disorders, we ran an exploratory analysis of the effects of NiBS on depressive symptoms, which showed significant decreases in post-treatment scores (SMCC = -0.71; 95% CI = [-1.1, -0.3], p < 0.001). These results provide initial evidence for developing NiBS as a feasible therapy for GD symptoms but further comprehensive research is needed to validate these findings. The limitations of the available literature are critically discussed.Copyright © 2023 by the authors.",Brain Sciences,Apr-23

wellbeing","Problematic gambling has been suggested to be a possible consequence of dopaminergic medications used mainly in neurological conditions, i.e. pramipexole and ropinirole, and possibly by one antipsychotic compound, aripiprazole. Patients with Parkinson's disease, restless legs syndrome and other conditions potentially treated with dopamine agonists, as well as patients treated for psychotic disorders, are vulnerable patient groups with theoretically increased risk of developing gambling disorder (GD), for example due to higher rates of mental ill-health in these groups. The aim of the present paper is to review the epidemiological, clinical, and neurobiological evidence of the association between dopaminergic medications and GD, and to describe risk groups and treatment options. The neurobiology of GD involves the reward and reinforcement system, based mainly on mesocorticolimbic dopamine projections, with the nucleus accumbens being a crucial area for developing addictions to substances and behaviors. The addictive properties of gambling can perhaps be explained by the reward uncertainty that activates dopamine signaling in a pathological manner. Since reward-related learning is mediated by dopamine, it can be altered by dopaminergic medications, possibly leading to increased gambling behavior and a decreased impulse control. A causal relationship between the medications and GD seems likely, but the molecular mechanisms behind this association have not been fully described yet. More research is needed in order to fully outline the clinical picture of GD developing in patient groups with dopaminergic medications, and data are needed on the differentiation of risk in different compounds. In addition, very few interventional studies are available on the management of GD induced by dopaminergic medications. While GD overall can be treated, there is need for treatment studies testing the effectiveness of tapering of the medication or other gambling-specific treatment modalities in these patient groups.Copyright © 2023, The Author(s).",Pharmaceutical Medicine,Jan-23

treatment outcome","Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative pathology, the origin of which is associated with the death of neuronal cells involved in the production of dopamine. The prevalence of PD has increased exponentially. The aim of this review was to describe the novel treatments for PD that are currently under investigation and study and the possible therapeutic targets. The pathophysiology of this disease is based on the formation of alpha-synuclein folds that generate Lewy bodies, which are cytotoxic and reduce dopamine levels. Most pharmacological treatments for PD target alpha-synuclein to reduce the symptoms. These include treatments aimed at reducing the accumulation of alpha-synuclein (epigallocatechin), reducing its clearance via immunotherapy, inhibiting LRRK2, and upregulating cerebrosidase (ambroxol). Parkinson's disease continues to be a pathology of unknown origin that generates a significant social cost for the patients who suffer from it. Although there is still no definitive cure for this disease at present, there are numerous treatments available aimed at reducing the symptomatology of PD in addition to other therapeutic alternatives that are still under investigation. However, the therapeutic approach to this pathology should include a combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies to maximise outcomes and improve symptomatological control in these patients. It is therefore necessary to delve deeper into the pathophysiology of the disease in order to improve these treatments and therefore the quality of life of the patients.Copyright © 2023 by the authors.",Pharmaceutics,Mar-23

Current pharmacological approaches to treat tobacco use disorder (TUD) are only partly effective and novel approaches are needed. Dopamine has a well-established role in substance use disorders, including TUD, and there has been a long-standing interest in developing agents that target the dopaminergic system to treat substance use disorders. Dopamine has 5 receptor subtypes (DRD1 to DRD5). Given the localization and safety profile of the dopamine receptor D3 (DRD3), it is of therapeutic potential for TUD. In this chapter, the preclinical and clinical literature investigating the role of DRD3 in processes relevant to TUD will be reviewed, including in nicotine reinforcement, drug reinstatement, conditioned stimuli and cue-reactivity, executive function, and withdrawal. Similarities and differences in findings from the animal and human work will be synthesized and findings will be discussed in relation to the therapeutic potential of targeting DRD3 in TUD.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,2023

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a promising treatment that has attracted much attention for addiction treatment in recent years. The present review aimed to systematically identify the positive and adverse effects of DBS in human and animal models to evaluate the feasibility of DBS as a treatment for psychostimulant abuse. The current study also examined the possible mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of DBS. In February 2022, a comprehensive search of four databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane, and Scopus, was carried out to identify all reports that DBS was a treatment for psychostimulant addiction. The selected studies were extracted, summarized, and evaluated using the appropriate methodological quality assessment tools. The results indicated that DBS could reduce relapse and the desire for the drug in human and animal subjects without any severe side effects. The underlying mechanisms of DBS are complex and likely vary from region to region in terms of stimulation parameters and patterns. DBS seems a promising therapeutic option. However, clinical experiences are currently limited to several uncontrolled case reports. Further studies with controlled, double-blind designs are needed. In addition, more research on animals and humans is required to investigate the precise role of DBS and its mechanisms to achieve optimal stimulation parameters and develop new, less invasive methods.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Neurochemical Research,May-23

Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale","Introduction: Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is not only a therapeutic option but also an investigational tool to explore circuits and subjective dimensions in pathological conditions. Obsessive-Compulsive Related Disorders (OCRDs) shared similarities with Substance Use Disorder (SUD), suggesting the involvement of the reward system. This study aimed to verify the efficacy of targeting the reward system with rTMS in OCRDs. Method(s): Patients with trichotillomania, hoarding disorder and skin picking disorder were treated with rTMS over the left DorsoLateral PreFrontal Cortex (DLPFC) at 15 Hz, targeting the reward system via the connection with the nucleus accumbens and the ventral tegmental area. All patients were administered with psychometric scales assessing depression symptoms and severity of OCRDs symptoms at the baseline, at the end of the treatment and a 1-month follow-up. Result(s): Analysis of the results showed a reduction in symptom severity at the end of the treatment in all three groups (p < 0.0001) as well as a reduction in depression symptoms (p < 0.01). Improvements at 1-month follow-up were maintained only in younger patients. Indeed, when changes in scores at the follow-up were analyzed separately for younger (<30 years) and older patients (>60 years), the elderly showed again an increase in symptoms severity, suggesting that the stability of TMS effects over time reduces with age, possibly as an effect of age-related reduction in brain plasticity. Discussion(s): This study adopted with promising results a protocol (15 Hz over the left DLPFC) targeting the reward system, typically employed in addictions. These results can be in line with the view of OCRDs as behavioral addictions, suggesting the implication of common circuits, such as the reward system, in the mechanisms at the basis of these disorders.Copyright © 2023 Di Ponzio, Makris, Tenerini, Grassi, Ragone and Pallanti.",Frontiers in Psychiatry,03-Feb-23

Rehabilitation is the essential treatment for post-stroke patients suffering from functional impairments, through which hemiparesis, aphasia, dysphagia, unilateral neglect, depression, and cognitive dysfunction can be restored to various degrees. Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) is a popular neuromodulatory technology of rehabilitation focusing on the local cerebral cortex, which can improve clinical functions by regulating the excitability of corresponding neurons. Increasing evidence has been obtained from the clinical application of NIBS, especially repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). However, without a standardized protocol, existing studies on NIBS show a wide variation in terms of stimulation site, frequency, intensity, dosage, and other parameters. Its application for neurorehabilitation in post-stroke patients is still limited. With advances in neuronavigation technologies, functional near-infrared spectroscopy, and functional MRI, specific brain regions can be precisely located for stimulation. On the basis of our further understanding on neural circuits, neuromodulation in post-stroke rehabilitation has also evolved from single-target stimulation to co-stimulation of two or more targets, even circuits and the network. The present study aims to review the findings of current research, discuss future directions of NIBS application, and finally promote the use of NIBS in post-stroke rehabilitation.Copyright © 2023 by the authors.",Brain Sciences,Mar-23

Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale","Background: The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an effective deep brain stimulation target for Parkinson disease (PD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder and has been implicated in reward and motivational processing. In this study, we assessed the STN and prefrontal oscillatory dynamics in the anticipation and receipt of reward and loss using a task commonly used in imaging. Material(s) and Method(s): We recorded intracranial left subthalamic local field potentials from deep brain stimulation electrodes and prefrontal scalp electroencephalography in 17 patients with PD while they performed a monetary incentive delay task. Result(s): During the expectation phase, enhanced left STN delta-theta activity was observed in both reward and loss vs neutral anticipation, with greater STN delta-theta activity associated with greater motivation specifically to reward. In the consummatory outcome phase, greater left STN delta activity was associated with a rewarding vs neutral outcome, particularly with more ventral contacts along with greater delta-theta coherence with the prefrontal cortex. We highlight a differential activity in the left STN to loss vs reward anticipation, demonstrating a distinct STN high gamma activity. Patients with addiction-like behaviors show lower left STN delta-theta activity to loss vs neutral outcomes, emphasizing impaired sensitivity to negative outcomes. Conclusion(s): Together, our findings highlight a role for the left STN in reward and loss processing and a potential role in addictive behaviors. These findings emphasize the cognitive-limbic function of the STN and its role as a physiologic target for neuropsychiatric disorders.Copyright © 2022",Neuromodulation,Feb-23

Material(s) and Method(s): Two authors performed independent data base searches using the PubMed, Cochrane, PsycINFO, and Web of Science search engines. The data bases were searched for the query (""deep brain stimulation"" and ""habenula""). The inclusion criteria involved screening for human clinical trials written in English and published from 2007 to 2020. From the eligible studies, data were collected on the mean age, sex, number of patients included, and disorder treated. Patient outcomes of each study were summarized. Result(s): The search yielded six studies, which included 11 patients in the final analysis. Treated conditions included refractory depression, bipolar disorder, OCD, schizophrenia, and major depressive disorder. Patients with bipolar disorder unmedicated for at least two months had smaller habenula volumes than healthy controls. High-frequency stimulation of the lateral habenula attenuated the rise of serotonin in the dorsal raphe nucleus for treating depression. Bilateral habenula DBS and patient OCD symptoms were reduced and maintained at one-year follow up. Low- and high-frequency stimulation DBS can simulate input paths to the lateral habenula to treat addiction, including cocaine addiction. More data are needed to draw conclusions as to the impact of DBS for schizophrenia and obesity. Conclusion(s): The habenula is a novel target that could aid in reducing neuropsychiatric symptoms and should be considered in circuit-specific investigation of neuromodulation for psychiatric disorders. More information needs to be gathered and assessed before this treatment is fully approved for treatment of neuropsychiatric conditions.Copyright © 2022 The Authors",Neuromodulation,Feb-23

Structural and functional impairments within the OFC have been detected in many substance use disorders (SUDs). Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is proposed as a promising therapeutic option in treating SUDs. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the potential efficacy of DBS application on the various stages of the methamphetamine-conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm in rats. Main Method(s): Electrodes were implanted unilaterally in the rat's right OFC. DBS in the form of high- or low-frequency stimulation (HFS: 130 Hz, LFS: 13 Hz) was applied during the 5-day conditioning phase (a daily 30-min session) or extinction period (30-min session, daily, ten days) of methamphetamine-induced CPP in two separate sets of experiments. Following extinction, place preference was reinstated by injecting a priming dose of methamphetamine (0.25 mg/kg). Key Findings: The HFS and LFS significantly decreased the methamphetamine place preference when applied over the conditioning period. In the extinction experiment, only HFS could remarkably accelerate the extinction of reward-context associations and even reduce the methamphetamine-induced reinstatement of seeking behaviors. Significance: Conclusively, DBS administration in the OFC demonstrated some positive results, including suppressing effects on the development, maintenance, and relapse of methamphetamine-seeking behavior. These findings encourage conducting more preclinical studies to strongly suggest a wide range of DBS applications in cortical areas such as OFC as an efficient treatment modality for psychostimulant use disorder.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",Life Sciences,01-Jun-23

Understanding neural differences associated with tobacco use may help generate novel treatment options. Several animal studies have recently highlighted the central role of the thalamus in substance use disorders, but this research focus has been understudied in human smokers. Here, we investigated associations between structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging measures of the thalamus and its subnuclei to distinct smoking characteristics. We acquired anatomical scans of 32 smokers as well as functional resting-state scans before and after a cue-reactivity task. Thalamic functional connectivity was associated with craving and dependence severity, whereas the volume of the thalamus was associated with dependence severity only. Craving, which fluctuates rapidly, was best characterized by differences in brain function, whereas the rather persistent syndrome of dependence severity was associated with both brain structural differences and function. Our study supports the notion that functional versus structural measures tend to be associated with behavioural measures that evolve at faster versus slower temporal scales, respectively. It confirms the importance of the thalamus to understand mechanisms of addiction and highlights it as a potential target for brain-based interventions to support smoking cessation, such as brain stimulation and neurofeedback.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

ventral tegmentum

withdrawal syndrome","Aberrant glutamatergic signaling has been closely related to several pathologies of the central nervous system. Glutamatergic activity can induce an increase in neural plasticity mediated by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a nodal point in the mesolimbic dopamine system. Recent studies have related BDNF dependent plasticity in the VTA with the modulation of aversive motivation to deal with noxious environmental stimuli. The disarray of these learning mechanisms would produce an abnormal augmentation in the representation of the emotional information related to aversion, sometimes even in the absence of external environmental trigger, inducing pathologies linked to mood disorders such as depression and drug addiction. Recent studies point out that serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) receptors, especially the 2a (5-HT2a) subtype, play an important role in BDNF-related neural plasticity in the VTA. It has been observed that a single administration of a 5HT2a agonist can both revert an animal to a nondependent state from a drug-dependent state (produced by the chronic administration of a substance of abuse). The 5HT2a agonist also reverted the BDNF-induced neural plasticity in the VTA, suggesting that the administration of 5-HT2a agonists could be used as effective therapeutic agents to treat drug addiction. These findings could explain the neurobiological correlate of the therapeutic use of 5HT2a agonists, which can be found in animals, plants and fungi during traditional medicine ceremonies and rituals to treat mood related disorders.Copyright © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Journal of Psychoactive Drugs,2023

spatiotemporal analysis","Neurotransmitters are important chemical messengers in the nervous system that play a crucial role in physiological and physical health. Abnormal levels of neurotransmitters have been correlated with physical, psychotic, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, dementia, addiction, depression, and schizophrenia. Although multiple neurotechnological approaches have been reported in the literature, the detection and monitoring of neurotransmitters in the brain remains a challenge and continues to garner significant attention. Neurotechnology that provides high-throughput, as well as fast and specific quantification of target analytes in the brain, without negatively impacting the implanted region is highly desired for the monitoring of the complex intercommunication of neurotransmitters. Therefore, it is crucial to develop clinical assessment techniques that are sensitive and reliable to monitor and modulate these chemical messengers and screen diseases. This review focuses on summarizing the current electrochemical measurement techniques that are capable of sensing neurotransmitters with high temporal resolution in real time. Advanced neurotransmitter sensing platforms that integrate nanomaterials and biorecognition elements are explored.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.",Biosensors,Aug-20

substance use","Background: The use of neuromodulation in the treatment of psychiatric conditions is controversial despite its lengthy history. This particularly applies to the use of invasive neuromodulation, such as deep brain stimulation (DBS), to treat substance use disorder (SUD) due to the considerable risks of the procedures. However, given the advances in DBS research and the shortcomings of current treatment modalities for addiction, off-label use and clinical trials are being implemented for the management of treatment-refractory patients. Method(s): Here we conduct an ethical and legal analysis of DBS for SUD, referencing the four foundational principles of medical ethics and key legal concepts. Result(s): There are major concerns related to the capacity of a SUD patient to provide informed consent, as well as the risks and benefits of DBS compared to traditional treatment methods. In addition to ethical concerns, we explore potential legal issues that may arise from DBS in the treatment of addiction. These include the potential mandate of these procedures in the context of the criminalization of substance use, and the issue of familial consent in the decision-making process. Given the paucity of relevant clinical guidelines or legal cases, general medico-legal principles serve as the reference in making decisions about the responsible use of DBS as a treatment for addiction. Conclusion(s): Given the rapidly increasing evidence for DBS as a treatment for SUD, it is an urgent imperative to consider the relevant key ethical and legal issues. Incorporating IDEAL (Idea, Development, Exploration, Assessment, Long-term follow-up) framework into future research in DBS is recommended to evaluate patient safety and ethical perspectives. With the broad criminalization of SUD across the globe, legal coercion of DBS is not impossible, especially if proven to be effective to treat SUD. It is advised for stakeholders to urgently consider incorporating DBS-related drug policies so that the potential benefits of DBS within the rights of people with SUD are not hindered by the lack of clinical guidance and legislations.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",International Journal of Drug Policy,Mar-23

transcranial direct current stimulation","Long-term memory is achieved through a consolidation process where structural and molecular changes integrate information into a stable memory. However, environmental conditions constantly change, and organisms must adapt their behavior by updating their memories, providing dynamic flexibility for adaptive responses. Consequently, novel stimulation/experiences can be integrated during memory retrieval; where consolidated memories are updated by a dynamic process after the appearance of a prediction error or by the exposure to new information, generating edited memories. This review will discuss the neurobiological systems involved in memory updating including recognition memory and emotional memories. In this regard, we will review the salient and emotional experiences that promote the gradual shifting from displeasure to pleasure (or vice versa), leading to hedonic or aversive responses, throughout memory updating. Finally, we will discuss evidence regarding memory updating and its potential clinical implication in drug addiction, phobias, and post-traumatic stress disorder.Copyright © 2023 Osorio-Gomez, Miranda, Guzman-Ramos and Bermudez-Rattoni.",Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience,2023

ventromedial prefrontal cortex","Aim: In recent decades, the prevalence of amphetamine and methamphetamine use disorders has at least doubled in some regions/countries, with accompanying high risks of drug overdose-associated mortality. Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) methods may be effective treatments. However, the comparative efficacy of the NIBS protocol for amphetamine/methamphetamine use disorder (AUD/MUD) remains unknown to date. The aim of this network meta-analysis (NMA) was to compare the efficacy and acceptability of various NIBS methods/protocols for AUD/MUD management. Method(s): A frequentist model-based NMA was conducted. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated the efficacy of NIBS and guideline-recommended pharmacologic treatments to reduce craving severity in patients with either AUD or MUD. Result(s): Twenty-two RCTs including 1888 participants met the eligibility criteria. Compared with the sham/placebo group (study = 19, subjects = 891), a combination of intermittent theta burst stimulation over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and continuous TBS over the left ventromedial prefrontal cortex (study = 1, subjects = 19) was associated with the largest decreases in craving severity [standardized mean difference (SMD) = -1.50; 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) = -2.70 to -0.31]. High-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation over the left DLPFC was associated with the largest improvements in depression and quality of sleep (study = 3, subjects = 86) (SMD = -2.48; 95%CIs = -3.25 to -1.71 and SMD = -2.43; 95%CIs = -3.38 to -1.48, respectively). The drop-out rate of most investigated treatments did not significantly differ between groups. Conclusion(s): The combined TBS protocol over the prefrontal cortex was associated with the greatest improvement in craving severity. Since few studies were available for inclusion, additional large-scale randomized controlled trials are warranted.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

We addressed this gap by interviewing people with SUDs. METHOD(S): Participants viewed a short video introducing DBS, followed by a 1.5-hour semistructured interview on their experiences with SUDs and their perspective on DBS as a possible treatment option. Interviews were analyzed by multiple coders who iteratively identified salient themes. RESULT(S): We interviewed 20 people in 12-step-based, inpatient treatment programs (10 [50%] White/Caucasian, 7 Black/African American [35%], 2 Asian [10%], 1 Hispanic/Latino [5%], and 1 [5%] Alaska Native/American Indian; 9 women [45%], 11 men [55%]). Interviewees described a variety of barriers they currently faced through the course of their disease that mirrored barriers often associated with DBS (stigma, invasiveness, maintenance burdens, privacy risks) and thus made them more open to the possibility of DBS as a future treatment option. CONCLUSION(S): Individuals with SUDs gave relatively less weight to surgical risks and clinical burdens associated with DBS than previous surveys of provider attitudes anticipated. These differences derived largely from their experiences living with an often-fatal disease and encountering limitations of current treatment options. These findings support the study of DBS as a treatment option for SUDs, with extensive input from people with SUDs and advocates.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

Chronic stress and stimulant exposure interferes with decision-making, and can confer similar cognitive and behavioral inflexibilities. This review examines the literature on acute and chronic regulation of the epigenome by stress and stimulants. Recent evidence suggests that exposures to stress and stimulants share similarities in the manners in which they regulate the dorsal striatum epigenome through DNA methylation, transposable element activity, and histone post-translational modifications. These findings suggest that chronic stress and stimulant exposure leads to the accumulation of epigenetic modifications that impair immediate and future neuron function and activity. Such epigenetic mechanisms represent potential therapeutic targets for ameliorating convergent symptoms of stress and addiction.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s)",Trends in Neurosciences,Dec-22

Young Mania Rating Scale","Treatment resistance in alcohol use disorders (AUD) is a major problem for affected individuals and for society. In the search of new treatment options, few case studies using deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus accumbens have indicated positive effects in AUD. Here we report a double-blind randomized controlled trial comparing active DBS (""DBS-EARLY ON"") against sham stimulation (""DBS-LATE ON"") over 6 months in n = 12 AUD inpatients. This 6-month blind phase was followed by a 12-month unblinded period in which all patients received active DBS. Continuous abstinence (primary outcome), alcohol use, alcohol craving, depressiveness, anxiety, anhedonia and quality of life served as outcome parameters. The primary intention-to-treat analysis, comparing continuous abstinence between treatment groups, did not yield statistically significant results, most likely due to the restricted number of participants. In light of the resulting limited statistical power, there is the question of whether DBS effects on secondary outcomes can nonetheless be interpreted as indicative of an therapeutic effect. Analyses of secondary outcomes provide evidence for this, demonstrating a significantly higher proportion of abstinent days, lower alcohol craving and anhedonia in the DBS-EARLY ON group 6 months after randomization. Exploratory responder analyses indicated that patients with high baseline alcohol craving, depressiveness and anhedonia responded to DBS. The results of this first randomized controlled trial are suggestive of beneficial effects of DBS in treatment-resistant AUD and encourage a replication in larger samples.Copyright © 2023, The Author(s).",Translational Psychiatry,Dec-23

Our study investigated the effect of automatic vs. controlled processing during response inhibition in participants with mild-to-moderate AUD and matched healthy controls. For this, a Simon Nogo task was combined with EEG signal decomposition, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), and source localization methods. The final sample comprised n = 59 (32) AUD participants and n = 64 (28) control participants. Compared with the control group, AUD participants showed overall better response inhibition performance. Furthermore, the AUD group was less influenced by the modulatory effect of automatic vs. controlled processes during response inhibition (i.e., had a smaller Simon Nogo effect). The neurophysiological data revealed that the reduced Simon Nogo effect in the AUD group was associated with reduced activation differences between congruent and incongruent Nogo trials in the inferior and middle frontal gyrus. Notably, the drinking frequency (but not the number of AUD criteria we had used to distinguish groups) predicted the extent of the Simon Nogo effect. We suggest that the counterintuitive advantage of participants with mild-to-moderate AUD over those in the control group could be explained by the allostatic model of drinking effects.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.",Journal of Clinical Medicine,Nov-22

visual cortex","Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a highly prevalent, often refractory, medical illness. The symptoms of AUD are driven by dysfunction in several neurocircuits centered on the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Case reports and animal studies suggest NAc-DBS may be an effective harm-reduction treatment in severe AUD. Six patients with severe, refractory AUD underwent NAc-DBS. Safety metrics and clinical outcomes were recorded. Positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) was used to measure glucose metabolism in the NAc at baseline and 6 months. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to characterize postoperative changes in NAc functional connectivity to the rest of the brain, as well as NAc and dorsal striatal reactivity to alcoholic visual cues. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03660124. All patients experienced a reduction in craving. There was a significant reduction in alcohol consumption, alcohol-related compulsivity, and anxiety at 12 months. There was no significant change in depression. FDG-PET analysis demonstrated reduced NAc metabolism by 6 months, which correlated with improvements in compulsive drinking behaviors. Clinical improvement correlated with reduced functional connectivity between the NAc and the visual association cortex. Active DBS was associated with reduced activation of the dorsal striatum during passive viewing of alcohol-containing pictures. NAc-DBS is feasible and safe in patients with severe, otherwise refractory AUD. It is associated with a reduction in cravings and addictive behavior. A potential mechanism underlying this process is a down-regulation of the NAc, a disruption of its functional connectivity to the visual association cortex, and interference of cue-elicited dorsal striatum reactivity.

vulnerability","As the ability to capture single-cell expression profiles has grown in recent years, neuroscientists studying a wide gamut of brain regions have discovered remarkable heterogeneity within seemingly related populations (Saunders et al., 2018a; Zeisel et al., 2015). These ""molecular subtypes"" have been demonstrated even within brain nuclei expressing the same neurotransmitter (Saunders et al., 2018a; Poulin et al., 2020; Ren et al., 2019; Okaty et al., 2020). Recently, dopamine (DA) neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and adjacent ventral tegmental area (VTA) have been revealed to be diverse not only when comparing between these two dopaminergic nuclei, but within them, and with the distribution of identified subtypes often agnostic to traditional neuroanatomical boundaries (Saunders et al., 2018a; Hook et al., 2018; Kramer et al., 2018; La Manno et al., 2016; Poulin et al., 2014; Tiklova et al., 2019; Poulin et al., 2018). Such molecularly defined subpopulations have been the subject of several recent studies. Investigations of these subtypes have ultimately unveiled many distinctive properties across several domains, such as their axonal projections and functional properties (Poulin et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2019; Pereira Luppi et al., 2021; Evans et al., 2017; Evans et al., 2020). These key differences between subtypes have begun to corroborate the biological relevance of DA neuron taxonomic schemes. We hypothesize that these putative molecular subtypes, with their distinctive circuits, could shed light on the wide variety of dopamine-related symptoms observed across several diseases including depression, chronic pain, addiction, and Parkinson's Disease. While it is difficult to reconcile how a single neurotransmitter can be involved in so many seemingly unrelated phenotypes, one solution could be the existence of several individual dopaminergic pathways serving different functions, with molecular subtypes serving as distinct nodes for these pathways. Indeed, this conceptual framework is already the dogma for anatomically distinct DA pathways, including the mesocortical, mesolimbic and mesostriatal pathways (Bjorklund & Dunnett, 2007). Here, we discuss our existing knowledge of DA neuron subtypes and attempt to provide a roadmap for how their distinctive properties can provide novel insights into the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) (Fig. 1A). By exploring the differences between molecular subtypes and correlating this to their relative degeneration within the SNc, we may gain a deeper understanding of the cell-intrinsic mechanisms underlying why some DA neurons degenerate more than others in PD. Similarly, by mapping the inputs, projections, and functions of individual subtypes, we may better understand their individual roles in the circuit-level dysfunction of dopaminergic diseases.Copyright © 2022 The Authors",Neurobiology of Disease,Dec-22

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) as a non-invasive tool can be used to modulate neuronal activity, cortical excitability, and dopaminergic neurotransmission. This study aims to explore the efficacy of high-frequency rTMS in reducing drug craving and increasing decision-making ability for methamphetamine use disorder patients. Sixty-four methamphetamine use disorder patients were randomized to sham rTMS group and 10-Hz rTMS group. Visual analog scale (VAS) and Iowa game test (IGT) were used to evaluate drug craving and cognitive decision-making ability before and after treatment. Before the treatment, the two groups had no differences in the scores of VAS and IGT. After the intervention, VAS scores of 10-Hz rTMS group were significantly lower than that of sham rTMS group. In addition, the two groups had significant differences in the net score of IGT on block 4 and block 5, which favoured the 10-Hz rTMS group. Taken together, the present results suggest that High-frequency rTMS can be used to reduce drug craving and improve decision-making function for methamphetamine use disorder.Copyright © 2022",Psychiatry Research,Nov-22

This review aims to summarize and evaluate the preclinical and clinical studies of deep brain stimulation (DBS) as a novel therapy for refractory addiction, in hopes to engage and inform future research in this promising novel treatment avenue. An electronic database search (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane library) was performed using keywords and predefined inclusion criteria between 1974 and 6/18/2021 (registered on Open Science Registry). Selected articles were reviewed in full text and key details were summarized and analyzed to understand DBS' therapeutic potential and possible mechanisms of action. The search yielded 25 animal and 22 human studies. Animal studies showed that DBS of targets such as nucleus accumbens (NAc), insula, and subthalamic nucleus reduces drug use and seeking. All human studies were case series/reports (level 4/5 evidence), mostly targeting the NAc with generally positive outcomes. From the limited evidence in the literature, DBS, particularly of the NAc, appears to be a reasonable last resort option for refractory addictive disorders. We propose that future research in objective electrophysiological (e.g., local field potentials) and neurochemical (e.g., extracellular dopamine levels) biomarkers would assist monitoring the progress of treatment and developing a closed-loop DBS system. Preclinical literature also highlighted the prefrontal cortex as a promising DBS target, which should be explored in human research.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s).",Neurotherapeutics,Jul-22

transcranial magnetic stimulation","Both the cerebellum and the basal ganglia are known for their roles in motor control and motivated behavior. These two systems have been classically considered as independent structures that coordinate their contributions to behavior via separate cortico-thalamic loops. However, recent evidence demonstrates the presence of a rich set of direct connections between these two regions. Although there is strong evidence for connections in both directions, for brevity we limit our discussion to the better-characterized connections from the cerebellum to the basal ganglia. We review two sets of such connections: disynaptic projections through the thalamus and direct monosynaptic projections to the midbrain dopaminergic nuclei, the VTA and the SNc. In each case, we review the evidence for these pathways from anatomic tracing and physiological recordings, and discuss their potential functional roles. We present evidence that the disynaptic pathway through the thalamus is involved in motor coordination, and that its dysfunction contributes to motor deficits, such as dystonia. We then discuss how cerebellar projections to the VTA and SNc influence dopamine release in the respective targets of these nuclei: the NAc and the dorsal striatum. We argue that the cerebellar projections to the VTA may play a role in reward-based learning and therefore contribute to addictive behavior, whereas the projection to the SNc may contribute to movement vigor. Finally, we speculate how these projections may explain many of the observations that indicate a role for the cerebellum in mental disorders, such as schizophrenia.Copyright © 2022 the authors.",Journal of Neuroscience,09-Nov-22

withdrawal syndrome","An integrative model of sexual addiction is presented, involving a combination of models based upon (i) incentive motivation theory and (ii) the dual organisation of the control of behavior. The model is related to ongoing arguments about the validity of the notion of addiction when applied to sexual behavior. It is suggested that the evidence strongly favors the viability of an addiction model of sex. Strong similarities to the classical addiction to hard drugs are observed and features can be better understood with the help of the model. These include tolerance, escalation and withdrawal symptoms. It is argued that other candidates for accounting for the phenomena, such as obsessive-compulsive behavior, faulty impulse control, high drive and hypersexuality do not fit the evidence. The role of dopamine is central to the model. The model's relevance to stress, abuse, development, psychopathy, fantasy, sex differences, evolutionary psychology and the interaction with drug-taking is shown.Copyright © 2022",Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews,Nov-22

While opioid drugs have long been used to treat chronic pain, their use is severely limited by adverse effects and abuse liability. Neurostimulation techniques have emerged as a promising option for chronic pain that is refractory to other treatments. While different neurostimulation strategies have been applied to many neural structures implicated in pain processing, there is variability in efficacy between patients, underscoring the need to optimize neurostimulation techniques for use in pain management. This optimization requires a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying neurostimulation-induced pain relief. Here, we discuss the most commonly used neurostimulation techniques for treating chronic pain. We present evidence that neurostimulation-induced analgesia is in part driven by the release of endogenous opioids and that this endogenous opioid release is a common endpoint between different methods of neurostimulation. Finally, we introduce technological and clinical innovations that are being explored to optimize neurostimulation techniques for the treatment of pain, including multidisciplinary efforts between neuroscience research and clinical treatment that may refine the efficacy of neurostimulation based on its underlying mechanisms.Copyright © 2022 Lubejko, Graham, Livrizzi, Schaefer, Banghart and Creed.",Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience,14-Dec-22

treatment response","Treatment for brain diseases has been disappointing because available medications have failed to produce clinical response across all the patients. Many patients either do not respond or show partial and inconsistent effect, and even in patients who respond to the medications have high relapse rates. Brain stimulation has been seen as an alternative and effective remedy. As a result, brain stimulation has become one of the most valuable therapeutic tools for combating against brain diseases. In last decade, studies with the application of brain stimulation techniques not only have grown exponentially but also have expanded to wide range of brain disorders. Brain stimulation involves passing electric currents into the cortical and subcortical area brain cells with the use of noninvasive as well as invasive methods to amend brain functions. Over time, technological advancements have evolved into the development of precise devices; however, at present, most used noninvasive techniques are repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), whereas the most common invasive technique is deep brain stimulation (DBS). In the current review, we will provide an overview of the potential of noninvasive (rTMS and tDCS) and invasive (DBS) brain stimulation techniques focusing on the treatment of mental, psychiatric, and cognitive disorders.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

Additionally, animal models have demonstrated that both sleep restriction and sleep deprivation increase the preference for alcohol, methylphenidate, and the self-administration of cocaine. Therefore, the present review discusses current knowledge about the influence of sleep hours reduction on addictivebehaviors; likewise, we discuss the neuronal basis underlying the sleep reduction-addiction relationship, like the role of the orexin and dopaminergic system and neuronal plasticity (i.e., delta FosB expression). Potentially, chronic sleep restriction could increase brain vulnerability and promote addictive behavior.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews,Oct-22

tobacco use","Substance use disorder is a chronic and relapsing disease that burdens both the individual and the society. In addition to psychosocial treatment approaches, currently there are approved pharmacological treatment options for opioid, alcohol and tobacco use disorders, but only symptomatic treatment can be offered to patients with other substance use disorders. Advances in neuroscience and a better understanding of the addiction process offer an opportunity to create new treatment options. There is a wide range of studies, ranging from the use of drugs with different indications to the development of new pharmacological treatments, and from vaccine studies to neuromodulation techniques. Establishing novel treatment goals in addition to complete abstinence and individualizing treatment by focusing on endophenotypes may increase the treatment alternatives and the efficacy of these treatments for SUD.Copyright © 2022 by Turkish Association of Neuropsychiatry.",Noropsikiyatri Arsivi,Dec-22

More recently, a limited number of basic and clinical studies have indicated that DBS of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and other neighbouring structures of the reward circuit may be an effective intervention for patients with treatment-refractory addiction. We performed a structured literature review of human studies of DBS for addiction outlining the clinical efficacy and adverse events. We found 14 human studies targeting mostly the NAc with neighbouring structures such as anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC). Five studies including 12 patients reported the outcomes for alcohol dependence. Nine studies including 18 patients reported the outcomes for addictions to various psychoactive substances. The most common indication was addiction to heroin, found in 13 patients, followed by methamphetamine, 3 patients, cocaine, one patient, and polysubstance drug abuse in one patient. The limited clinical data available indicates that DBS may be a promising therapeutic modality for the treatment of intractable addiction. In general, the safety profile of DBS in patients with addiction is good. Based on the data published in the literature, the NAc is the most often targeted, and is probably the most effective, structure of the reward circuit in the treatment of addiction in humans. Given the ever-expanding understanding of the psychosurgery of addiction, DBS could in the future be a treatment option for patients suffering from intractable addictive disorders.",Neurologia i neurochirurgia polska,11-Oct-21

traction therapy [m]","Developing new, effective treatments for substance use disorders (SUDs), especially cocaine and opioid use disorders (CUD and OUD), are of immense importance. These are chronic, relapsing brain diseases characterized by dysregulated circuits manifesting from neuroplastic change brought on by repeated exposure to substances of abuse. A potential treatment is therapeutically inducing neuroplastic change in targeted dysregulated circuits. One such intervention, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has gained traction over the past two decades as a method of noninvasively stimulating cortical structures in order to induce subcortical neuroplastic change. By doing so, rTMS ameliorates symptoms that are consequent of dysregulations in disease-related circuits, such as craving, and reduces drug use. Although rTMS has been successfully applied as a treatment for other clinical disorders, progress toward treatment applications for SUDs has been stymied by what we dub ""known unknowns"". These are fundamental lines of research within the rTMS-SUD field that have yet to be systematically understood which could help to optimize TMS as an intervention for SUDs. Because progress in treatment for CUD and OUD is imperative given the widespread severity of OUD and the lack of treatment for CUD, it is necessary to critically reflect on the ways in which rTMS research for these disorders can most effectively move forward to help patients. We articulate six ""known unknowns"" and outline a direction of research to address each. Briefly, the ""known unknowns"" in the field are: 1) Cortical target selection, 2) subcortical circuit engagement, 3) optimizing rTMS sequences, 4) rTMS as an adjuvant to existing interventions, 5) manipulating brain state, and 6) selecting outcome measures. We also outline research design approaches to address these ""known unknowns"" in the rTMS-SUDs field. Unification of efforts across research laboratories is necessary to develop empirically validated treatments that will benefit patients in a timely fashion.Copyright © 2018.

Through electromagnetic induction, techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can noninvasively depolarize cortical cells in the induced electrical field and monosynaptic afferents. The ability of TMS to modulate the brain is dependent upon two factors, which may be compromised in individuals with AUD: (1) gray matter volume (GMV) at the site of stimulation and (2) scalp-to-cortex (STC) distance. This study tested the hypotheses that these aspects of neural architecture are compromised in AUD patients, and thus AUD patients may need a higher TMS dose to depolarize the cortex. Method(s): High-resolution magnetic resonance images were acquired from 44 individuals with AUD and 44 age-matched healthy controls (n = 88). Whole-brain voxel-based morphometry was conducted. Subsequent region-of-interest analysis was performed at three EEG 10-20 sites commonly used in TMS for AUD: FP1 (left frontal pole), F3 (left DLPFC), and C3 (left motor cortex). STC distance and TMS electric fields were assessed at these EEG sites. Result(s): Individuals with AUD had significantly lower GMV in the bilateral orbitofrontal cortices, supramarginal gyri, and the left DLPFC (voxel-threshold p < 0.05, cluster-threshold p < 0.05) and within all 3 TMS target locations, F (1, 264) = 14.12, p = 0.0002. There was no significant difference in STC distance between the AUD and the healthy control group at any tested cortical location, F (3, 252) = 1.906, p = 0.129. Conclusion(s): Individuals with AUD had significantly lower GMV in multiple areas of interest for TMS treatment; however, these volumetric reductions did not impact STC distance. Given previous studies that have shown TMS-evoked changes in cortical and subcortical activity to be dependent on GMV, these data suggest that individuals with AUD may require higher doses of TMS to sufficiently modulate the neural circuits of interest.Copyright © 2021 by the Research Society on Alcoholism",Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research,2021

transcranial magnetic stimulation [m]","INTRODUCTION: A significant proportion of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) display a set of impulsive-compulsive behaviors at some point during the course of illness. These behaviors range from the so-called behavioral addictions to dopamine dysregulation syndrome, punding and hoarding disorders. These behaviors have been consistently linked to the use of dopaminergic medications used to treat PD motor symptoms (dopamine agonists, levodopa, and other agents) and less consistently to neuromodulation techniques such as deep brain stimulation (DBS). Since there are still no approved treatments for these conditions, their pharmacological management is still a big challenge for clinicians. METHOD(S): We conducted an extensive review of current pharmacological and neuromodulation literature for the management of impulsive-compulsive disorders in PD patients. RESULT(S): Pharmacological treatment approaches for impulsive-compulsive behaviors and DDS in PD patients include reduction of levodopa (LD), reduction/cessation of dopamine agonist (DA), and initiation of infusion therapies (apomorphine infusion and duodopa). Also, atomoxetine, a noradrenergic agent approved for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, showed some interesting preliminary results but there is still a lack of controlled longitudinal studies. Finally, while DBS effects on impulsive-compulsive disorders are still controversial, non-invasive techniques (such as transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation) could have a potential positive effect but, again, there is still a lack of controlled trials. CONCLUSION(S): Managing impulsivity and compulsivity in PD patients is still a non-evidence-based challenge for clinicians. Controlled trials on promising approaches such as atomoxetine and non-invasive neuromodulation techniques are needed.",Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology,14-Apr-21

smoking cessation [m]","The expanding legalization of cannabis across the United States is associated with increases in cannabis use, and accordingly, an increase in the number and severity of individuals with cannabis use disorder (CUD). The lack of FDA-approved pharmacotherapies and modest efficacy of psychotherapeutic interventions means that many of those who seek treatment for CUD relapse within the first few months. Consequently, there is a pressing need for innovative, evidence-based treatment development for CUD. Preliminary evidence suggests that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) may be a novel, non-invasive therapeutic neuromodulation tool for the treatment of a variety of substance use disorders (SUDs), including recently receiving FDA clearance (August 2020) for use as a smoking cessation aid in tobacco cigarette smokers. However, the potential of rTMS for CUD has not yet been reviewed. This paper provides a primer on therapeutic neuromodulation techniques for SUDs, with a particular focus on reviewing the current status of rTMS research in people who use cannabis. Lastly, future directions are proposed for rTMS treatment development in CUD, with suggestions for study design parameters and clinical endpoints based on current gold-standard practices for therapeutic neuromodulation research.Copyright © 2019.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive therapeutic tool which has emerged as a potential treatment option for these patients. It is still unclear, however, if the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) or the motor cortex (MC) is a more effective treatment location. The purpose of this study was to directly compare the effects of DLPFC versus MC TMS on pain severity and the urge to use opiates among chronic pain patients. METHOD(S): Twenty-two individuals with chronic pain currently using prescription opiates were randomized to receive 10, 3000 pulse sessions of 10 Hz repetitive TMS (rTMS) to the left DLPFC (110% resting motor threshold) or left MC (90% resting motor threshold). Multivariate linear models were used to evaluate the effect of TMS on pain and opiate use, including items from the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) as well as subjective ratings of pain, distress, and the urge for opiates. RESULT(S): Twenty participants (91%) completed all 10 treatment sessions and follow up visits. There was a main effect of stimulation site (F7,210 = 3.742, p = 0.001), wherein MC stimulation decreased pain interference significantly more than DLPFC stimulation (F1,216 = 8.447, p = 0.004). While both sites had comparable effect sizes on stress, pain, and discomfort, MC stimulation had larger effects on pain interference (Cohen's d: 0.7) and urge to use opiates (Cohen's d: 0.5) than DLPFC stimulation. CONCLUSION(S): These data suggest that the MC may be a promising target for decreasing opiate dependence and pain interference among chronic pain patients.Copyright © 2020.

Cannabidiol (CBD), in particular, has anxiolytic, antipsychotic and anticonvulsant properties and plays a role in regulating motivation circuitry and controlling sleep disorders. Several studies were performed evaluating CBD in experimental models for cocaine. This systematic review aims evaluate the potential use of CBD in the treatment of cocaine use disorder. METHOD(S): Five databases (Scielo; Medline/PubMed; PsycINFO; Cochrane Library; Virtual Health Library-VHL) were searched up to January 2020. Full-text reports published in English were included if they were experimental studies that administered CBD to human and/or adult animals in use or with a history of crack/cocaine administration. The risk of bias of each study selected was appraised by two independent reviewers following the Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation (SYRCLE) protocol. MAJOR FINDINGS: Fifty-one studies were analyzed, and 14 were selected. No studies conducted with humans were found; only one clinical trial was ongoing. The results were grouped into the following categories: cocaine self-administration, brain-stimulation reward, conditioned place preference, neuronal proliferation, anxiety, hepatic protection, anticonvulsant effect and locomotor sensitization response Only four studies had a low risk of bias. CBD promotes reduction on cocaine self-administration. Also, it interferes in cocaine induce brain reward stimulation and dopamine release. CBD promotes alteration in contextual memory associated with cocaine and in the neuroadaptations, hepatotoxicity and seizures induced by cocaine. CONCLUSION(S): The evidence indicates that CBD is a promising adjunct therapy for the treatment of cocaine dependence due to its effect on: cocaine reward effects, cocaine consumption, behavioral responses, anxiety, neuronal proliferation, hepatic protection and safety. Moreover, clinical trials are strongly required to determine whether the findings in animal models occur in humans diagnosed for cocaine or crack cocaine use disorder.Copyright © 2018.

Moreover, the rapid onset of societal disruption and evolving regulatory restrictions may not have allowed for systematic planning of how clinical and research work may continue throughout the pandemic or be restarted as restrictions are abated. The urgency to provide and develop NIBS as an intervention for diverse neurological and mental health indications, and as a catalyst of fundamental brain research, is not dampened by the parallel efforts to address the most life-threatening aspects of COVID-19; rather in many cases the need for NIBS is heightened including the potential to mitigate mental health consequences related to COVID-19. OBJECTIVE(S): To facilitate the re-establishment of access to NIBS clinical services and research operations during the current COVID-19 pandemic and possible future outbreaks, we develop and discuss a framework for balancing the importance of NIBS operations with safety considerations, while addressing the needs of all stakeholders. We focus on Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and low intensity transcranial Electrical Stimulation (tES) - including transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS). METHOD(S): The present consensus paper provides guidelines and good practices for managing and reopening NIBS clinics and laboratories through the immediate and ongoing stages of COVID-19. The document reflects the analysis of experts with domain relevant expertise spanning NIBS technology, clinical services, and basic and clinical research - with an international perspective. We outline regulatory aspects, human resources, NIBS optimization, as well as accommodations for specific demographics. RESULT(S): A model based on three phases (early COVID-19 impact, current practices, and future preparation) with an 11-step checklist (spanning removing or streamlining in-person protocols, incorporating telemedicine, and addressing COVID-19-associated adverse events) is proposed. Recommendations on implementing social distancing and sterilization of NIBS related equipment, specific considerations of COVID-19 positive populations including mental health comorbidities, as well as considerations regarding regulatory and human resource in the era of COVID-19 are outlined. We discuss COVID-19 considerations specifically for clinical (sub-)populations including pediatric, stroke, addiction, and the elderly. Numerous case-examples across the world are described. CONCLUSION(S): There is an evident, and in cases urgent, need to maintain NIBS operations through the COVID-19 pandemic, including anticipating future pandemic waves and addressing effects of COVID-19 on brain and mind. The proposed robust and structured strategy aims to address the current and anticipated future challenges while maintaining scientific rigor and managing risk.Copyright © 2020.

*transcranial electrical stimulation [m]","Oscillatory brain activities support many physiological functions from motor control to cognition. Disruptions of the normal oscillatory brain activities are commonly observed in neurological and psychiatric disorders including epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, anxiety/trauma-related disorders, major depressive disorders, and drug addiction. Therefore, these disorders can be considered as common oscillation defects despite having distinct behavioral manifestations and genetic causes. Recent technical advances of neuronal activity recording and analysis have allowed us to study the pathological oscillations of each disorder as a possible biomarker of symptoms. Furthermore, recent advances in brain stimulation technologies enable time- and space-targeted interventions of the pathological oscillations of both neurological disorders and psychiatric disorders as possible targets for regulating their symptoms.Copyright © 2020.

treatment response [m]","Gambling disorder (GD) is a behavioral addiction, in which dysfunctions in prefrontal activity have been proposed as relevant pathophysiological correlates. The aim of the present study was to preliminarily investigate the feasibility of a noninvasive neuromodulation intervention targeting the prefrontal cortex to treat GD in an open-label setting. We included 8 treatment-seeking patients with GD (7 males; 1 female; mean age: 40.6 +/- 11.2). The study consisted of 3 phases: (1) outpatient screening phase, (2) 2-week intensive repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) treatment phase (twice daily, 5 days/week for 2 weeks); and (3) 3-month maintenance follow-up phase (twice daily, once a week). Each high-frequency (15 Hz) rTMS session was delivered targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. GD severity and treatment response were assessed at the baseline and during the follow-up. No relevant side effect was reported. We found a 71.2% Gambling Symptom Assessment Scale mean score reduction after 2 weeks of rTMS treatment; the days spent gambling decreased from 19.63 +/- 7.96 to 0.13 +/- 0.35 days. Clinical improvements were maintained throughout the study period. The lack of a control group limits the interpretation of these results. In conclusion, these results consolidate the rationale that rTMS interventions deserve further investigation as a potential treatment for GD. These protocols should be tested in larger randomized controlled studies, to determine the real benefits of neuromodulation in the clinical course of patients with GD.

This is also the case for noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques being investigated as potential treatment interventions for SUDs and BAs. OBJECTIVE(S): to contribute to the development of more effective NIBS protocols for BAs. METHOD(S): Two literature searches using PubMed and Google Scholar were conducted identifying a total of 35 studies. The first search identified 25 studies examining the cognitive and neurophysiological overlap between BAs and SUDs. The second search yielded 10 studies examining the effects of NIBS in BAs. RESULT(S): Impulsivity and cravings show behavioral and neurophysiologic overlaps between BAs and SUDs, however, other outcomes like working-memory abilities or striatal connectivity, differ between BAs and SUDs. The most-employed NIBS target in BAs was dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), which was associated with a decrease in cravings, and less frequently with a reduction of addiction severity. CONCLUSIONS AND SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: Direct comparisons between BAs and SUDs revealed discrepancies between behavioral and neurophysiological outcomes, but overall, common and distinctive characteristics underlying each disorder. The lack of complete overlap between BAs and SUDs suggests that investigating the cognitive and neurophysiological features of BAs to create individual NIBS protocols that target risk-factors associated specifically with BAs, might be more effective than transferring protocols from SUDs to BAs. Individualizing NIBS protocols to target specific risk-factors associated with each BA might help to improve treatment interventions for BAs.

It is estimated that TS affects about 1% of children. Risk factors include male gender, family history of tics, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Transient tic disorders in childhood are much more common than TS. Twenty percent of children, boys more commonly than girls, have motor tics which disappear as they get older. According to DSM-IV, the standard diagnostic criteria for TS consist of (1) presence of multiple motor tics and one or more vocal tics, (2) tics occurring many times daily for more than 3 consecutive months, (3) onset younger than 18 years of age, and (4) a tic disorder not due to substance abuse or another underlying diagnosis.Copyright © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2012.",,2012

ventral tegmentum","Repeated psychostimulant exposure progressively increases their potency to stimulate motor activity in rodents. This behavioral or locomotor sensitization is considered a model for some aspects of drug addiction in humans, particularly drug craving during abstinence. However, the role of increased motor behavior in drug reward remains incompletely understood. Intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) was measured concurrently with locomotor activity to determine if acute intermittent cocaine administration had distinguishable effects on motor behavior and perception of brain stimulation-reward (BSR) in the same mice. Sensitization is associated with changes in neuronal activity and glutamatergic neurotransmission in brain reward circuitry. Expression of AMPA receptor subunits (GluR1 and GluR2) and CRE binding protein (CREB) was measured in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), dorsolateral striatum (STR) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) before and after a sensitizing regimen of cocaine, with and without ICSS. Repeated cocaine administration sensitized mice to its locomotor-stimulating effects but not its ability to potentiate BSR. ICSS increased GluR1 in the VTA but not NAc or STR, demonstrating selective changes in protein expression with electrical stimulation of discrete brain structures. Repeated cocaine reduced GluR1, GluR2 and CREB expression in the NAc, and reductions of GluR1 and GluR2 but not CREB were further enhanced by ICSS. These data suggest that the effects of repeated cocaine exposure on reward and motor processes are dissociable in mice, and that reduction of excitatory neurotransmission in the NAc may predict altered motor function independently from changes in reward perception. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Alcoholism can affect the gastrointestinal, neurological, cardiovascular and respiratory systems, and it can be fatal, costing the healthcare system huge amounts of money. Despite the availability of cognitive-behavioural and psychosocial therapies, alcoholism has a high recurrence rate and a dismal prognosis, with a wide inter-individual variation. As a result, better or adjuvant therapies that improve or facilitate alcoholism therapy are required. We conducted a systematic review to look into the published studies that reported the effectiveness of non-pharmacological neurofeedback (NF) interventions in patients with alcohol use disorders (AUDs). Method(s): PubMed, Google Scholar, The Cochrane Library, Science Direct and Clinicaltrial.gov were searched until 4 April 2022. Original articles of any design reporting on the use of NF approaches in the treatment of AUDs were included. Information related to study design, participants, control group, neuromodulation therapy, number of sessions and key findings of the study were extracted. The Joanna Briggs Institute's (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist for Studies was used to assess the quality of studies. Result(s): A total of 20 research articles (including 618 participants) were retrieved and included for qualitative analysis. The sample size ranged from 1 (case report) to 80, with years of publication ranging from 1977 to 2022. Nine of the 20 articles included in the study were conducted in the United States, followed by Germany, the United Kingdom, India, the Netherlands and South Korea. Out of the 20 studies included, 8 (40%) had a moderate risk of bias, while the other, i.e. 60% had a low risk of bias. The effectiveness of various neurological treatments in the treatment of AUDs was established in these 20 studies. There have been 11 studies on EEG NF training, three studies on real-time FMRI NF, two studies each on transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and one study each on deep brain stimulation (DBS) and theta burst stimulation (TBS). These alternative neurological therapies have been demonstrated to lower alcohol cravings and consumption temporarily, reduce anxiety and depression scores, reduce relapse rates and increase control of brain activity. Conclusion(s): The use of various neuromodulation approaches to the treatment of AUD shows promise. However, more research with larger sample size is required.Copyright © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",World Journal of Biological Psychiatry,2022

Web of Science [m]","Addiction to psychostimulants significantly affects public health. Standard medical therapy is often not curative. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a promising treatment that has attracted much attention for addiction treatment in recent years. The present review aimed to systematically identify the positive and adverse effects of DBS in human and animal models to evaluate the feasibility of DBS as a treatment for psychostimulant abuse. The current study also examined the possible mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of DBS. In February 2022, a comprehensive search of four databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane, and Scopus, was carried out to identify all reports that DBS was a treatment for psychostimulant addiction. The selected studies were extracted, summarized, and evaluated using the appropriate methodological quality assessment tools. The results indicated that DBS could reduce relapse and the desire for the drug in human and animal subjects without any severe side effects. The underlying mechanisms of DBS are complex and likely vary from region to region in terms of stimulation parameters and patterns. DBS seems a promising therapeutic option. However, clinical experiences are currently limited to several uncontrolled case reports. Further studies with controlled, double-blind designs are needed. In addition, more research on animals and humans is required to investigate the precise role of DBS and its mechanisms to achieve optimal stimulation parameters and develop new, less invasive methods.Copyright © 2022.

social anxiety","Reward Deficiency Syndrome (RDS) is defined as a breakdown of reward neurotransmission that results in a wide range of addictive, compulsive, and impulsive behaviors. RDS is caused by a combination of environmental (epigenetic) influences and DNA-based (genetic) neurotransmission deficits that interfere with the normal satisfaction of human physiological drives (i.e., food, water, and sex). An essential feature of RDS is the lack of integration between perception, cognition, and emotions that occurs because of (1) significant dopaminergic surges in motivation, reward, and learning centers causing neuroplasticity in the striato-thalamic-frontal cortical loop; (2) hypo-functionality of the excitatory glutamatergic afferents from the amygdala-hippocampus complex. A large volume of literature regarding the known neurogenetic and psychological underpinnings of RDS has revealed a significant risk of dopaminergic gene polymorphic allele overlap between cohorts of depression and subsets of schizophrenia. The suggestion is that instead of alcohol, opioids, gambling disorders, etc. being endophenotypes, the true phenotype is RDS. Additionally, reward deficiency can result from depleted or hereditary hypodopaminergia, which can manifest as a variety of personality traits and mental/medical disorders that have been linked to genetic studies with dopamine-depleting alleles. The carrying of known DNA antecedents, including epigenetic insults, results in a life-long vulnerability to RDS conditions and addictive behaviors. Epigenetic repair of hypodopaminergia, the causative basis of addictive behaviors, may involve precision DNA-guided therapy achieved by combining the Genetic Addiction Risk Severity (GARS) test with a researched neutraceutical having a number of variant names, including KB220Z. This nutraceutical formulation with pro-dopamine regulatory capabilities has been studied and published in peer-reviewed journals, mostly from our laboratory. Finally, it is our opinion that RDS should be given an ICD code and deserves to be included in the DSM-VI because while the DSM features symptomology, it is equally important to feature etiological roots as portrayed in the RDS model.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.",Journal of Personalized Medicine,Oct-22

subthalamic nucleus","Objective: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective surgical treatment for patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). DBS therapy, particularly with the subthalamic nucleus (STN) target, has been linked to rare psychiatric com-plications, including depression, impulsivity, irritability, and suicidality. Stimulation-induced elevated mood states can also occur. These episodes rarely meet DSM-5 criteria for mania or hypomania. Method(s): The investigators conducted a chart review of 82 patients with PD treated with DBS. Result(s): Nine (11%) patients developed stimulation-induced elevated mood. Five illustrative cases are described (all males with STN DBS; mean age=62.2 years [SD=10.5], mean PD duration=8.6 years [SD=1.6]). Elevated mood states oc-curred during or shortly after programming changes, when more ventral contacts were used (typically in monopolar mode) and lasted minutes to months. Four patients experi-enced elevated mood at low amplitudes (1.0 V/1.0 mA); all had psychiatric risk factors (history of impulse-control dis-order, dopamine dysregulation syndrome, substance use disorder, and/or bipolar diathesis) that likely contributed to mood destabilization. Conclusion(s): Preoperative DBS evaluations should include a thorough assessment of psychiatric risk factors. The term ""stimulation-induced elevated mood states"" is pro-posed to describe episodes of elevated, expansive, or irri-table mood and psychomotor agitation that occur during or shortly after DBS programming changes and may be associated with increased goal-directed activity, impulsivity, grandiosity, pressured speech, flight of ideas, or decreased need for sleep and may persist beyond stimulation adjust-ments. This clinical phenomenon should be considered for inclusion in the bipolar disorder category in future DSM re-visions, allowing for increased recognition and appropriate management.Copyright © 2021, American Psychiatric Association.

THC is the major psychoactive, addiction-promoting, and psychotomimetic compound, while CBD may have opposite effects. The brain effects of these drugs alone and in combination are poorly understood. In particular, the striatum is implicated in the pathophysiology of several psychiatric disorders, but it is unclear how THC and CBD influence striato-cortical connectivity. Aim(s): To examine effects of THC, CBD, and THC + CBD on functional connectivity of striatal sub-divisions (associative, limbic and sensorimotor). Method(s): Resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) was used across two within-subjects, placebo-controlled, double-blind studies, with a unified analysis approach. Result(s): Study 1 (N = 17; inhaled cannabis containing 8 mg THC, 8 mg THC + 10 mg CBD or placebo) showed strong disruptive effects of both THC and THC + CBD on connectivity in the associative and sensorimotor networks, but a specific effect of THC in the limbic striatum network which was not present in the THC + CBD condition. In Study 2 (N = 23, oral 600 mg CBD, placebo), CBD increased connectivity in the associative network, but produced only relatively minor disruptions in the limbic and sensorimotor networks. Outcome(s): THC strongly disrupts striato-cortical networks, but this effect is mitigated by co-administration of CBD in the limbic striatum network. Oral CBD administered has a more complex effect profile of relative increases and decreases in connectivity. The insula emerges as a key region affected by cannabinoid-induced changes in functional connectivity, with potential implications for understanding cannabis-related disorders, and the development of cannabinoid therapeutics.Copyright © The Author(s) 2022.",Journal of Psychopharmacology,Jun-22

Recent Findings: Recent work has embedded clinical recognition of psychiatric symptoms in dystonia, with depressive and anxiety-related symptoms routinely observed to be the most common. Less explored symptoms, such as self-harm, suicidal ideation, and substance abuse, represent newer areas of investigation, with initial work suggesting higher rates than the background population. Investigation of cognitive function has provided less consistent results, both within individual dystonia subtypes and across the spectrum of dystonias, partly reflecting the heterogeneity in approaches to assessment. However, recent work indicates impairments of higher cognitive function, e.g. social cognition, and disrupted visual and auditory sensory processing. Summary: Dystonia demonstrates psychiatric and cognitive symptom heterogeneity, with further work needed to recognise endophenotypes and improve diagnostic accuracy, symptom recognition, and management.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s).",Current Neurology and Neuroscience Reports,Nov-22

treatment outcome","Substance use disorders (SUDs) constitute a growing global health crisis, yet many limitations and challenges exist in SUD treatment research, including the lack of objective brain-based markers for tracking treatment outcomes. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a neurophysiological technique for measuring brain activity, and although much is known about EEG activity in acute and chronic substance use, knowledge regarding EEG in relation to abstinence and treatment outcomes is sparse. We performed a scoping review of longitudinal and pre-post treatment EEG studies that explored putative changes in brain function associated with abstinence and/or treatment in individuals with SUD. Following PRISMA guidelines, we identified studies published between January 2000 and March 2022 from online databases. Search keywords included EEG, addictive substances (e.g., alcohol, cocaine, methamphetamine), and treatment related terms (e.g., abstinence, relapse). Selected studies used EEG at least at one time point as a predictor of abstinence or other treatment-related outcomes; or examined pre- vs. post-SUD intervention (brain stimulation, pharmacological, behavioral) EEG effects. Studies were also rated on the risk of bias and quality using validated instruments. Forty-four studies met the inclusion criteria. More consistent findings included lower oddball P3 and higher resting beta at baseline predicting negative outcomes, and abstinence-mediated longitudinal decrease in cue-elicited P3 amplitude and resting beta power. Other findings included abstinence or treatment-related changes in late positive potential (LPP) and N2 amplitudes, as well as in delta and theta power. Existing studies were heterogeneous and limited in terms of specific substances of interest, brief times for follow-ups, and inconsistent or sparse results. Encouragingly, in this limited but maturing literature, many studies demonstrated partial associations of EEG markers with abstinence, treatment outcomes, or pre-post treatment-effects. Studies were generally of good quality in terms of risk of bias. More EEG studies are warranted to better understand abstinence- or treatment-mediated neural changes or to predict SUD treatment outcomes. Future research can benefit from prospective large-sample cohorts and the use of standardized methods such as task batteries. EEG markers elucidating the temporal dynamics of changes in brain function related to abstinence and/or treatment may enable evidence-based planning for more effective and targeted treatments, potentially pre-empting relapse or minimizing negative lifespan effects of SUD.Copyright © 2022 Bel-Bahar, Khan, Shaik and Parvaz.",Frontiers in Human Neuroscience,17-Oct-22

vulnerability","Substance use disorders (SUD) may emerge from an individual's attempt to limit negative affective states and symptoms linked to stress. Indeed, SUD is highly comorbid with chronic stress, traumatic stress, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and treatments approved for each pathology individually often failed to have a therapeutic efficiency in such comorbid patients. The kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) and its endogenous ligand dynorphin (DYN), seem to play a key role in the occurrence of this comorbidity. The DYN/KOR function is increased either in traumatic stress or during drug use, dependence acquisition and DYN is released during stress. The behavioural effects of stress related to the DYN/KOR system include anxiety, dissociative and depressive symptoms, as well as increased conditioned fear response. Furthermore, the DYN/KOR system is implicated in negative reinforcement after the euphoric effects of a drug of abuse ends. During chronic drug consumption DYN/KOR functions increase and facilitate tolerance and dependence. The drug-seeking behaviour induced by KOR activation can be retrieved either during the development of an addictive behaviour, or during relapse after withdrawal. DYN is known to be one of the most powerful negative modulators of dopamine signalling, notably in brain structures implicated in both reward and fear circuitries. KOR are also acting as inhibitory heteroreceptors on serotonin neurons. Moreover, the DYN/KOR system cross-regulate with corticotropin-releasing factor in the brain. The sexual dimorphism of the DYN/KOR system could be the cause of the gender differences observed in patients with SUD or/and traumatic stress-related pathologies. This review underlies experimental and clinical results emphasizing the DYN/KOR system as common mechanisms shared by SUD or/and traumatic stress-related pathologies, and suggests KOR antagonist as a new pharmacological strategy to treat this comorbidity.Copyright © 2022 Leconte, Mongeau and Noble.",Frontiers in Pharmacology,27-Apr-22

Young Mania Rating Scale","Background and Objectives: Ketamine is a rapid-acting antidepressant with proven efficacy as an add-on agent in unipolar and bipolar treatment-resistant depression. Although many studies have been published, there is still not enough data on the effect of ketamine in combination with other medications. Particularly interesting is the combination of ketamine and lamotrigine, and its potential role in bipolar depression. The aim of this review was to identify animal and human studies in which ketamine and lamotrigine were used together in order to find out if there is scientific ground for combining ketamine and lamotrigine in the treatment of mood disorders. Directions for future studies are presented. Material(s) and Method(s): PubMed and Web of Science were searched. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses PRISMA 2020 methodology was applied. Result(s): Seventeen studies were included for review. Animal studies using models of depression suggested a synergistic effect of ketamine and lamotrigine in combination. Studies on healthy humans showed a reduction in ketamine-induced dissociative symptoms with lamotrigine pretreatment. In a study on patients with depression, ketamine and lamotrigine did not have a stronger antidepressant effect than ketamine alone, but in this study only one ketamine infusion was administered. One case series described the antidepressant and anti-suicidal effect of the combination in two bipolar patients. Available clinical studies on patients with mood disorders did not support the hypothesis that lamotrigine reduces ketamine-induced dissociative symptoms. Conclusion(s): The results of the analyzed studies were not sufficient to answer any of the stated questions; however, they allowed us to delineate future research directions. The identified animal studies suggested a possible synergistic antidepressant effect of ketamine and lamotrigine. The available clinical studies were not conclusive. No controlled studies on large groups of bipolar patients with multiple ketamine infusions combined with lamotrigine treatment have been published so far. There is some evidence for the reduction of ketamine's side effects by lamotrigine, and there are reports suggesting that lamotrigine can reduce ketamine craving. More studies with follow-up are needed in order to investigate the ketamine-lamotrigine combination in bipolar patients.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

transcranial magnetic stimulation","Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is characterized by excessive habitual drinking and loss of control over alcohol intake despite negative consequences. Both of these aspects foster uncontrolled drinking and high relapse rates in AUD patients. Yet, common interventions mostly focus on the phenomenological level, and prioritize the reduction of craving and withdrawal symptoms. Our review provides a mechanistic understanding of AUD and suggests alternative therapeutic approaches targeting the mechanisms underlying dysfunctional alcohol-related behaviours. Specifically, we explain how repeated drinking fosters the development of rigid drinking habits and is associated with diminished cognitive control. These behavioural and cognitive effects are then functionally related to the neurobiochemical effects of alcohol abuse. We further explain how alterations in fronto-striatal network activity may constitute the neurobiological correlates of these alcohol-related dysfunctions. Finally, we discuss limitations in current pharmacological AUD therapies and suggest non-invasive brain stimulation (like TMS and tDCS interventions) as a potential addition/alternative for modulating the activation of both cortical and subcortical areas to help re-establish the functional balance between controlled and automatic behaviour.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews,Feb-22

ventral striatum","Neuroimaging studies have identified a variety of brain regions whose activity predicts substance use (i.e., relapse) in patients with substance use disorder (SUD), suggesting that malfunctioning brain networks may exacerbate relapse. However, this knowledge has not yet led to a marked improvement in treatment outcomes. Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) has shown some potential for treating SUDs, and a new generation of NIBS technologies offers the possibility of selectively altering activity in both superficial and deep brain structures implicated in SUDs. The goal of the current review was to identify deeper brain structures involved in relapse to SUD and give an account of innovative methods of NIBS that might be used to target them. Included studies measured fMRI in currently abstinent SUD patients and tracked treatment outcomes, and fMRI results were organized with the framework of the Addictions Neuroclinical Assessment (ANA). Four brain structures were consistently implicated: the anterior and posterior cingulate cortices, ventral striatum and insula. These four deeper brain structures may be appropriate future targets for the treatment of SUD using these innovative NIBS technologies.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews,Oct-22

Method(s): The survey questionnaire was based on review of available evidence, with questions designed to capture service location, transition clinic structure, and core issues discussed. The questionnaire was digitalized as an online survey and sent to all members of the MDS. Result(s): Responses were received from a total of 252 MDS members representing 67 countries. Of the responders, 59% confirmed that they provided transition clinics for adolescents with movement disorders. Overall, there was some consensus regarding transition services in terms of patient age at transition, movement disorder etiologies, staffing the service, and medical/social issues discussed. Conclusion(s): This survey provides first-hand data of existing movement disorder transition services and provides useful insights on transition clinics.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

Five sessions of iTBS were carried over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) or the vertex as a sham control, with each session in one day. Orientation free-recall tasks were conducted before the iTBS stimulation, after the first and fifth sessions of stimulation. Results showed that when compared with the sham group, a single session of iTBS over the left DLPFC improved participants' working memory performance. Specifically, iTBS over the left DLPFC increased the working memory capacity and such effects enlarged with multiple sessions. The present finding suggested that iTBS over DLPFC could be a promising intervention method to enhance the cognitive function of addicts with MUD.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.",Brain Sciences,Sep-22

A growing body of research has suggested higher daily stress is associated with blunted cortisol response to acute psychosocial stressors. However, so far, the neural mechanism underlying this association has not been elucidated. The current study aimed to examine the role of stress neurocircuitry between the hippocampus and the ventral medial prefrontal cortex in this relationship. Method(s): To this end, as an index of daily stress in 44 young healthy individuals (23 females; mean [standard deviation] age = 19.07 [1.11] years), the total stressful rating score of daily life stress events that occurred in a 24-hour period was quantified. Individuals were then administered a modified version of the Montreal Imaging Stress Task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging scans, and their saliva samples were collected for assessment of the stress hormone cortisol. Result(s): Results revealed that a higher level of daily stress was associated with lower salivary cortisol secretion (r = -0.39, p = .008) and lower activation of the left hippocampus (tpeak = -5.51) in response to the Montreal Imaging Stress Task. Furthermore, a higher level of daily stress was associated with stronger functional connectivity between the left hippocampus and the ventral medial prefrontal cortex/ subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (tpeak = 4.91, R2 = 0.365). Conclusion(s): Taken together, the current study suggested a possible neurocircuitry of the hippocampus and ventral medial prefrontal cortex in the relationship between daily life stress and acute psychosocial stress.Copyright © 2022 by the American Psychosomatic Society",Psychosomatic Medicine,01-Apr-22

Method(s): A total of 90 male patients with AUD who were hospitalized were enrolled and divided into study and waiting groups by a random number table. During the study, 18 patients dropped out. After the alcohol withdrawal symptoms were eliminated, the study group received high-frequency rTMS at 10 Hz for 14 consecutive days, and the waiting group was administrated by sham rTMS. All subjects were evaluated for attention cue reactivity, impulsiveness, cognitive function by oddball paradigm, Barratt Impulsiveness Scale version II (BIS-II), and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) at baseline and after true or sham rTMS. Result(s): 1. There was no significant difference between the study and the waiting groups regarding the drinking level, cognition level, and demographic data at baseline. 2. In the oddball paradigm, both for alcohol-related and non-alcohol-related cues, the response times were significantly shorter in the study group after rTMS treatment than in the waiting-for-treatment group, either between the two groups or within the study group. There was no significant difference in the accuracy rate for alcohol-related and non-alcohol-related cues between the two groups or within the study group after rTMS intervention. 3. The total score of MoCA was significantly increased, and the total score of BIS-II was significantly decreased in the study group after rTMS treatment, either between the two groups or within the study group. Conclusion(s): The results suggested that high-frequency rTMS could improve the attention bias of alcohol-related cues and impulsivity for patients with AUD.Copyright © 2022 Feng, Wu, Wu, Zeng, Yuan, Wang, Kang and Yang.",Frontiers in Psychiatry,29-Apr-22

white matter","Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique which is now being used in psychiatry clinics across the world as a therapeutic tool for a variety of neural-circuit based disorders (e.g., major depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, substance use disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, headache, pain). The higher volume of use and publication of multiple large-scale clinical trials has provided researchers with a unique opportunity to retrospectively evaluate factors influencing TMS treatment responses in large samples of patients. While many studies have focused on TMS protocol parameters as moderators of treatment efficacy, sex/gender is another critical, often overlooked factor influencing TMS treatment outcome. Women, especially during periods of high estradiol, appear to be particularly sensitive to the therapeutic effects of rTMS. This manuscript makes a case for three potential biological explanations for these findings. Drawing on literature from cranio-facial anatomy, neuroimaging, and neuroendocrine fields, we posit that observed increases in response rates of women in clinical rTMS trials may be related to: (1) Closer proximity of the brain to the scalp at the prefrontal cortex, leading to larger TMS induced electric fields especially at the medial prefrontal cortex, (2) Greater gray matter density and gyrification in the prefrontal cortex, and (3) High levels of estradiol which facilitate cortical excitability. These biological explanations are empirical ideas which have been evaluated in laboratory studies and lend themselves to prospective evaluation in multisite clinical rTMS trials. The existing literature on this topic and these three potential biological explanations all indicate that the TMS field should routinely evaluate sex/gender (and associated biological metrics like scalp-to-cortex distance, gray matter density, estradiol/progesterone levels) as a factor that may influence treatment outcome.Copyright © 2022 Hanlon and McCalley.",Frontiers in Psychiatry,29-Apr-22

systematic review","The trajectory of the use of dopamine replacement therapy (DRT) in Parkinson's disease (PD) is variable and doses may need to be increased, but also tapered. The plan for dose adjustment is usually done as per drug information recommendations from the licensing bodies, but there are no clear guidelines with regards to the best practice regarding the tapering off schedule given sudden dose reductions of drugs such as dopamine agonists may have serious adverse consequences. A systematic literature search was, therefore, performed to derive recommendations and the data show that there are no controlled studies or evidence-based recommendations how to taper or discontinue PD medication in a systematic manner. Most of the data were available on the dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome (DAWS) and we found only two instructions on how to reduce pramipexole and rotigotine published by the EMA. We suggest that based on the available data, levodopa, dopamine agonists (DA), and amantadine should not be discontinued abruptly. Abrupt or sudden reduction of DA or amantadine in particular can lead to severe life-threatening withdrawal symptoms. Tapering off levodopa, COMT inhibitors, and MAO-B inhibitors may worsen motor and non-motor symptoms. Based on our clinical experience, we have proposed how to reduce PD medication and this work will form the basis of a future Delphi panel to define the recommendations in a consensus.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",Journal of Neural Transmission,Sep-22

Aims This study assessed the impact of health conditions on perceived stigma and QoL in persons with PD. We hypothesised that individuals with more health conditions would report more stigma and poorer QoL. We also examined the contributions of demographic and clinical characteristics to the correlations between health conditions and perceived stigma/QoL. Methods We identified 196 eligible participants from the Boston University Online Survey Study of Parkinson's Disease and examined their health history, performance on multiple stigma measures, and scores on the 39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire assessing QoL. Results At least one health condition was reported by 79% of the sample, with a median of 2 and a range of 0-7 health conditions. More perceived stigma and poorer QoL were associated with thyroid disease, depression, anxiety, and the total number of health conditions. These correlations were related to younger age, less education, and earlier disease onset. Other health conditions (high blood pressure, back/leg surgery, headache, cancer/tumours, and heart disease) were not significantly correlated with stigma or QoL. Conclusions Having more health conditions, or thyroid disease, depression, or anxiety, was associated with more perceived stigma and poorer QoL, with younger age, less education, and earlier disease onset affecting the associations. It is important to consider the burden of health conditions and how they affect persons with PD with specific clinical characteristics.Copyright ©",General Psychiatry,01-Jun-22

Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale","Background: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a well-established procedure for treating Parkinson's disease (PD). Although its mechanisms of action are still unclear, improvements in motor symptoms and reductions in medication side effects can be achieved for a significant proportion of patients, with consequent enhancement of quality of life. Objective(s): To investigate the impact of DBS on the quality of life of PD patients. Method(s): This was a retrospective longitudinal study with collection of historical data in a neurosurgery center, from June 2019 to December 2020. The sample was obtained according to convenience, and the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39), Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) III and IV, Trail-Making Test and Verbal Fluency Test were used. Result(s): Data were collected from 17 patients (13 with subthalamic nucleus DBS and 4 with globus pallidus pars interna DBS). Significant improvement (p=0.008) on the UPDRS III was observed in comparing the preoperative without DBS with the postoperative with DBS. About 47.0% of the patients showed post-surgical improvement in QoL (p=0.29). Thirteen patients were able to complete part A of the Trail-Making Test and four of these also completed part B. Almost 60% of the patients scored sufficiently on the semantic test, whereas only 11.8% scored sufficiently on the orthographic evaluation. No association between implant site and test performance could be traced. Conclusion(s): Improvements in quality of life and motor function were observed in the majority of the patients enrolled. Despite the limitations of this study, DBS strongly benefits a significant proportion of PD patients when well indicated.Copyright © 2022 Associacao Arquivos de Neuro-Psiquiatria.

ventral tegmentum","Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a chronic and complex disease characterized by repeated relapses and remissions. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been discussed again and again as a potentially helpful neuromodulatory procedure in this context. In this review, for the first time, we intended to systematically identify the positive and negative effects of DBS in human and animal models of opioid dependence to assess the viability of DBS as a treatment of OUD. Eligible studies were incorporated by a comprehensive literature search and evaluated through proper methodological quality assessment tools. Findings showed that the nucleus accumbens was the most stimulated brain target in human and animal studies, and DBS was applied chiefly in the form of high-frequency stimulation (HFS). DBS administration effectively reduced opioid craving and consumption in human and animal subjects dependent on opioids. DBS represents a valuable alternative strategy for treating intractable opioid addiction. Based on our systematic literature analysis, research efforts in this field should be continued.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",Brain Research Bulletin,Sep-22

Method(s): We conducted an umbrella review (PubMed/Cochrane Library/PsycINFO-04-Jul-2021, PROSPERO/CRD42020158827) for meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on deep brain stimulation (DBS), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), electro-convulsive therapy (ECT), and others. Co-primary outcomes were standardized mean differences (SMD) of disease-specific symptoms, and acceptability (for all-cause discontinuation). Evidence was assessed with AMSTAR/AMSTAR-Content/GRADE. Result(s): We selected 102 meta-analyses. Effective interventions compared to sham were in depressive disorders: ECT (SMD=0.91/GRADE=moderate), TMS (SMD=0.51/GRADE=moderate), tDCS (SMD=0.46/GRADE=low), DBS (SMD=0.42/GRADE=very low), light therapy (SMD=0.41/GRADE=low); schizophrenia: ECT (SMD=0.88/GRADE=moderate), tDCS (SMD=0.45/GRADE=very low), TMS (prefrontal theta-burst, SMD=0.58/GRADE=low; left-temporoparietal, SMD=0.42/GRADE=low); substance use disorder: TMS (high frequency-dorsolateral-prefrontal-deep (SMD=1.16/GRADE=moderate), high frequency-left dorsolateral-prefrontal (SMD=0.77/GRADE=very low); OCD: DBS (SMD=0.89/GRADE=moderate), TMS (SMD=0.64/GRADE=very low); PTSD: TMS (SMD=0.46/GRADE=moderate); generalized anxiety disorder: TMS (SMD=0.68/GRADE=low); ADHD: tDCS (SMD=0.23/GRADE=moderate); autism: tDCS (SMD=0.97/GRADE=very low). No significant differences for acceptability emerged. Median AMSTAR/AMSTAR-Content was 8/2 (suggesting high-quality meta-analyses/low-quality RCTs), GRADE low. Discussion(s): Despite limited certainty, biological non-pharmacological interventions are effective and safe for numerous mental conditions. Results inform future research, and guidelines.

The vast majority of patients remained mentally addicted to drugs after physical drug addiction has been eliminated and the organism has been completely detoxed. It is an indomitable desire to take drugs. Neurophysiological mechanisms are in base of psychological dependence. It is similar to those that implement obsessive states (obsessive-compulsive disorders). The central role in these neurophysiological mechanisms is played by limbic system of the brain that provides emotional and motivational behavior of humans (and animals). It was shown that the treatment of medical-resistant forms of obsessive-compulsive disorders requires stereotactic impacts on various structures of the limbic system, including cingulate gyrus. According to literature data, there was several hundred stereotactic effects on the cingulate gyrus in the world. About 1000 stereotactic operations have been performed in our country as a mental addiction of heroin dependent patients' treatment. The efficiency was of about 70%.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",,Jan-22

somnolence","The effects of alcohol on human sleep were first described almost 70 years ago. Since then, accumulating evidences suggest that alcohol intake at bed time immediately induces sleep [reduces the time to fall asleep (sleep onset latency), and consolidates and enhances the quality (delta power) and the quantity of sleep]. Such potent sleep promoting activity makes alcohol as one of the most commonly used ""over the counter"" sleep aid. However, the somnogenic effects, after alcohol intake, slowly wane off and often followed by sleep disruptions during the rest of the night. Repeated use of alcohol leads to the development of rapid tolerance resulting into an alcohol abuse. Moreover, chronic and excessive alcohol intake leads to the development of alcohol use disorder (AUD). Alcoholics, both during drinking periods and during abstinences, suffer from a multitude of sleep disruptions manifested by profound insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness, and altered sleep architecture. Furthermore, subjective and objective indicators of sleep disturbances are predictors of relapse. Finally, within the USA, it is estimated that societal costs of alcohol-related sleep disorders exceed $18 billion. Thus, although alcohol associated sleep problems have significant economic and clinical consequences, very little is known about how and where alcohol acts to affect sleep. In this review, a conceptual framework and clinical research focused on understanding the relationship between alcohol and sleep is first described. In the next section, our new and exciting preclinical studies, to understand the cellular and molecular mechanism of how acute and chronic alcohol affects sleep, are described. In the end, based on observations from our recent findings and related literature, opportunities for the development of innovative strategies to prevent and treat AUD are proposed.Copyright © 2022",Brain Research Bulletin,May-22

young adult","Background: The transition to college is associated with increased risk of alcohol misuse and a consequent increase in negative, alcohol-related social and health impacts. Traits associated with ongoing brain maturation during this period, including impulsivity in emotional contexts, could contribute to risky alcohol use. Method(s): This functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study examined brain network activation strength during an emotional inhibitory control task (Go-NoGo), which required participants to ignore background images with negative or neutral emotional valence during performance. Participants were 60 college freshmen (aged 18-20 years, 33 women). Survey measures, completed at baseline and one-year follow-up (follow-up n = 52, 29 women), assessed alcohol misuse alcohol use disorders identification test (AUDIT), alcohol/substance use counseling center assessment of psychological symptoms (C-CAPS), and negative consequences of alcohol use young adult alcohol consequences questionnaire (YAACQ). Measures were examined relative to network activation strength, on the Negative NoGo > Neutral NoGo contrast, of four large-scale brain networks implicated in top-down regulation of cognition and attention: right and left lateral frontoparietal networks (rL-FPN; lL-FPN), dorsal attention network (DAN), and salience network (SN). Result(s): Activation strength of DAN was negatively associated with scores on the AUDIT (p = 0.013) and YAACQ (p = 0.004) at baseline, and with C-CAPS score at baseline and follow-up (p = 0.002; p = 0.005), and positively associated with accuracy on NoGo trials with negative backgrounds (p = 0.014). Activation strength of rL-FPN was positively associated with C-CAPS score at follow-up (p = 0.003). SN activation strength was negatively associated with accuracy on NoGo trials with negative (p < 0.001) and neutral (p = 0.002) backgrounds and with the accuracy difference between negative versus neutral NoGo trials (p = 0.003). Conclusion(s): These findings suggest that less engagement of large-scale brain circuitry that supports top-down attentional control, specifically during negative emotions, is associated with more problematic drinking in emerging adults who attend college. This pattern of network activation may serve as a risk marker for ongoing self-regulation deficits during negative emotion that could increase risk of problematic alcohol use and negative impacts of drinking.Copyright © 2022 by the Research Society on Alcoholism",Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research,Mar-22

Three members of the family suffered from treatment-refractory severe myoclonic jerks of the neck, trunk, and upper extremities. The mild dystonic symptoms recognized as cervical dystonia or truncal dystonia affected all individuals. The efficacy of pharmacotherapy, including anticholinergic, dopaminergic, and serotoninergic drugs, has failed. One individual developed an alcohol dependency and suffered from alcoholic epilepsy. Material(s) and Method(s): The patients were referred for stereotactic surgery. All individuals underwent bilateral implantation of deep brain stimulation (DBS) leads into the posteroventrolateral segment of the globus pallidus internus (GPi). Surgeries were uneventful. The formal preoperative objective assessment included the Unified Myoclonus Rating Scale (UMRS) and the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFMDRS). The postoperative UMRS and BFMDRS assessments were done only under continuous stimulation at 3, 6, and 12 months after the surgery and at the last available follow-up ranging from 6 to 15 months (mean, 10 months follow-up). Result(s): At the last follow-up visit, the rest and action parts of UMRS were improved by 93.3% and 88.2%, respectively, when compared to the baseline scores. The motor and disability scales of BFMDRS were improved by 77% and 43% at the last follow-up visit compared to the baseline BFMDRS scores. There were no hardware or stimulation-induced complications over the follow-up period. Positive social adjustment allowed two patients to regain jobs and one patient continued his education and hobbies. Conclusion(s): Our experience gathered in three individuals in the family with a mutation in SGCE indicates that bilateral GPi DBS can be an effective and safe treatment for disabling pharmacological resistant, intractable M-D syndrome.Copyright © 2022 International Neuromodulation Society",Neuromodulation,Aug-22

Specifically, SS may modulate reward and stress-related brain responses to mitigate perceptions of alcohol reward and stress. There is limited evidence, however, on this topic and specifically on brain networks that may modulate SS effects on stress and alcohol reward. Here we present a review of the current literature on this topic as well as data from a large community sample of 115 social drinkers. Findings from a novel fMRI task viewing alcohol cue, stress, and neutral images, in separate blocks, while providing ratings on subjective feelings of alcohol craving, stress, and arousal are included. Lower SS significantly predicted greater alcohol craving during alcohol cue and stress conditions, higher baseline levels of stress, and greater arousal in the alcohol cue, relative to neutral condition. Remarkably, individuals with low SS showed greater reward activation (ventral medial prefrontal cortex (VmPFC) and ventral striatum) during alcohol cue exposure, while those with high SS showed no such activation (p < 0.001, family wise error corrected at 0.05). Furthermore, individuals with lower SS showed greater stress circuit (VmPFC, dorsal striatum, and periaqueductal gray) activation not observed in the high SS groups. Both groups showed increased amygdala activation under stress condition. The findings support the notion that SS is a powerful modulator of stress response and reward motivation. High SS buffers neural and subjective stress responses, while low SS potentiates greater reward seeking with higher alcohol craving and greater brain activation during alcohol cue exposure. Previous research and current results suggest the need to further explore the role of SS in those at risk of developing alcohol use disorder and assess novel prevention strategies to boost SS in at-risk drinkers.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,2022

In recent years, neuromodulation has gained momentum as an adjunctive treatment for improving outcomes in patients who are treatment-refractory. One form of neuromodulation, deep brain stimulation (DBS), has been investigated for the treatment of various psychiatric disorders and behavioral/cognitive symptoms. The following article provides a review of DBS investigations for several psychiatric and behavioral-related disorders, including depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, substance use disorder, Alzheimer's disease, anorexia, obesity, schizophrenia, and posttraumatic stress disorder. PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, Ovid MEDLINE, and Web of Science were used to identify published articles, and Clinicaltrials.gov was used to identify currently ongoing or planned studies. Findings revealed the potential utility of DBS in improving outcomes for various psychiatric and behavioral/cognitive-related disorders. While promising, there are several limitations present in the available literature, and further well-designed clinical trials are necessary before conclusive decisions regarding the utility of DBS for the treatment of these psychiatric/behavioral/cognitive-related disorders can be made. Regardless, the studies included in this review demonstrate positive preliminary findings for the potential benefit of DBS for treatment of a variety of psychiatric disorders, and further research is warranted to better determine the potential utility of DBS for those who are treatment-refractory and unable to achieve symptom relief with standard care.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Journal of the Neurological Sciences,15-Jun-22

vagus nerve stimulation","Psychosurgery refers to an ensemble of more or less invasive techniques designed to reduce the burden caused by psychiatric diseases in patients who have failed to respond to conventional therapy. While most surgeries are designed to correct apparent anatomical abnormalities, no discrete cerebral anatomical lesion is evident in most psychiatric diseases amenable to invasive interventions. Finding the optimal surgical targets in mental illness is troublesome. In general, contemporary psychosurgical procedures can be classified into one of two primary modalities: lesioning and stimulation procedures. The first group is divided into (a) thermocoagulation and (b) stereotactic radiosurgery or recently introduced transcranial magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound, whereas stimulation techniques mainly include deep brain stimulation (DBS), cortical stimulation, and the vagus nerve stimulation. The most studied psychiatric diseases amenable to psychosurgical interventions are severe treatment-resistant major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, Tourette syndrome, anorexia nervosa, schizophrenia, and substance use disorder. Furthermore, modern neuroimaging techniques spurred the interest of clinicians to identify cerebral regions amenable to be manipulated to control psychiatric symptoms. On this way, the concept of a multi-nodal network need to be embraced, enticing the collaboration of psychiatrists, psychologists, neurologists and neurosurgeons participating in multidisciplinary groups, conducting well-designed clinical trials.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",,Jan-22

Still, a variable percentage of them demonstrate resistance to conventional treatments, and alternative methods can then be considered. During the last 20 years, there is a progressive interest in use of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in mental illnesses. It has become clear nowadays, that this modality may be effectively applied under specific indications in some patients with major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, anorexia nervosa and other eating disorders, Tourette syndrome, schizophrenia, substance use disorder, and even pathologically aggressive behavior. Despite the fact that the efficacy of neuromodulation with DBS, as well as of various lesional interventions, in cases of mental illnesses is still not fully established, there are several premises for wider applications of such ""unclassical"" psychiatric treatments in the future. Novel technologies of DBS, developments in non-invasive lesioning using stereotactic radiosurgery and transcranial magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound, and advances of neurophysiological and neuroimaging modalities may bolster further clinical applications of psychiatric neurosurgery, improve its results, and allow for individually selected treatment strategies tailored to specific needs of the patient.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",,Jan-22

visual stimulation","Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a promising treatment modality for psychiatric and neurological disorders. Repetitive TMS (rTMS) is widely used for the treatment of psychiatric and neurological diseases, such as depression, motor stroke, and neuropathic pain. However, the underlying mechanisms of rTMS-mediated neuronal modulation are not fully understood. In this respect, concurrent or simultaneous TMS-fMRI, in which TMS is applied during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), is a viable tool to gain insights, as it enables an investigation of the immediate effects of TMS. Concurrent application of TMS during neuroimaging usually causes severe artifacts due to magnetic field inhomogeneities induced by TMS. However, by carefully interleaving the TMS pulses with MR signal acquisition in the way that these are far enough apart, we can avoid any image distortions. While the very first feasibility studies date back to the 1990s, recent developments in coil hardware and acquisition techniques have boosted the number of TMS-fMRI applications. As such, a concurrent application requires expertise in both TMS and MRI mechanisms and sequencing, and the hurdle of initial technical set up and maintenance remains high. This review gives a comprehensive overview of concurrent TMS-fMRI techniques by collecting (1) basic information, (2) technical challenges and developments, (3) an overview of findings reported so far using concurrent TMS-fMRI, and (4) current limitations and our suggestions for improvement. By sharing this review, we hope to attract the interest of researchers from various backgrounds and create an educational knowledge base.Copyright © 2022 Mizutani-Tiebel, Tik, Chang, Padberg, Soldini, Wilkinson, Voon, Bulubas, Windischberger and Keeser.",Frontiers in Psychiatry,21-Apr-22

serotonin syndrome","Psilocybin as a novel treatment for depression is garnering a lot of attention from both the mainstream media and the academic community. Although phase 3 trials are only just beginning, we feel that it is important for clinicians to consider what psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy might look like in the clinical setting. In this narrative review article we have considered the difficulties that may arise as psilocybin emerges from the research setting, which may hamper its progress towards becoming a licenced medication. Psilocybin has its own unique challenges: the expectation patients come to dosing with having read overwhelmingly positive media; patient suggestibility under the influence of psilocybin and requirement for specialised therapists to name a few. We have also made some recommendations for measures that should be taken in both the phase 3 trials and with clinicians to try and minimise some of the issues raised. In doing so our hope is that psilocybin will continue towards becoming a licenced medication that suitable patients are able to access with relative ease. Practicing psychiatrists need to have an awareness of the potential pitfalls of psilocybin as they will be responsible for prescribing it in the future.Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.",Therapeutic Advances in Psychopharmacology,Apr-22

substantia nigra pars reticulata","Drug addiction is a chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by compulsive drug-seeking and drug-using behavior, and a tremendous socioeconomic burden to society. Current pharmacological and psychosocial methods have shown limited treatment effects for substance abuse. Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is a novel treatment for psychiatric disease and has gradually gained popularity in the treatment of addiction. Addiction is characterized by neuroplastic changes in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key structure in the brain reward system, and DBS in this region has shown promising treatment effects. In this paper, the research progress on DBS for drug addiction has been reviewed. Specifically, we discuss the mechanism of NAc DBS for addiction treatment and summarize the results of clinical trials on DBS treatment for addiction to psychoactive substances such as nicotine, alcohol, cocaine, opioids and methamphetamine/amphetamine. In addition, the treatment effects of DBS in other brain regions, such as the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) and insula are discussed.Copyright © 2022 Chang, Peng, Chen, Liao, Zhao, Zou and Tan.",Frontiers in Psychiatry,07-Apr-22

*treatment-resistant schizophrenia / *drug therapy / *therapy","Antipsychotic drugs are the mainstay in the treatment of schizophrenia. However, one-third of patients do not show adequate improvement in positive symptoms with non-clozapine antipsychotics. Additionally, approximately half of them show poor response to clozapine, electroconvulsive therapy, or other augmentation strategies. However, the development of novel treatment for these conditions is difficult due to the complex and heterogenous pathophysiology of treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS). Therefore, this review provides key findings, potential treatments, and a roadmap for future research in this area. First, we review the neurobiological pathophysiology of TRS, particularly the dopaminergic, glutamatergic, and GABAergic pathways. Next, the limitations of existing and promising treatments are presented. Specifically, this article focuses on the therapeutic potential of neuromodulation, including electroconvulsive therapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation, and deep brain stimulation. Finally, we propose multivariate analyses that integrate various perspectives of the pathogenesis, such as dopaminergic dysfunction and excitatory/inhibitory imbalance, thereby elucidating the heterogeneity of TRS that could not be obtained by conventional statistics. These analyses can in turn lead to a precision medicine approach with closed-loop neuromodulation targeting the detected pathophysiology of TRS.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",Molecular Psychiatry,Jul-22

traumatic brain injury","Objectives: This review investigates the efficacy and safety of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) combined with psychosocial intervention on depressive symptoms. Material(s) and Method(s): We systematically searched five electronic databases from their inception to June 2021: PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Medline. Randomized or non-randomized clinical trials in which NIBS plus psychosocial intervention was compared to control conditions in people with depressive symptoms were included. Result(s): A total of 17 eligible studies with 660 participants were included. The meta-analysis results showed that NIBS combined with psychosocial therapy had a positive effect on moderate to severe depression ([SMD = - 0.46, 95%CI (- 0.90, - 0.02), I2 = 73%, p <.01]), but did not significantly improve minimal to mild depression ([SMD = - 0.12, 95%CI (- 0.42, 0.18), I2 = 0%, p =.63]). Compared with NIBS alone, the combination treatment had a significantly greater effect in alleviating depressive symptoms ([SMD = - 0.84, 95%CI (- 1.25, - 0.42), I2 = 0%, p =.93]). However, our results suggested that the pooled effect size of ameliorating depression of NIBS plus psychosocial intervention had no significant difference compared with the combination of sham NIBS [SMD = - 0.12, 95%CI (- 0.31, 0.07), I2 = 0%, p =.60] and psychosocial intervention alone [SMD = - 0.97, 95%CI (- 2.32, 0.38), I2 = 72%, p =.01]. Conclusion(s): NIBS when combined with psychosocial intervention has a significant positive effect in alleviating moderately to severely depressive symptoms. Further well-designed studies of NIBS combined with psychosocial intervention on depression should be carried out to consolidate the conclusions and explore the in-depth underlying mechanism.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s).",BMC Psychiatry,Dec-22

Review

stria terminalis","Opioid withdrawal can be associated to environmental cues through classical conditioning. Exposure to these cues can precipitate a state of conditioned withdrawal in abstinent subjects, and there are suggestions that conditioned withdrawal can perpetuate the addiction cycle in part by promoting the storage of memories. This review discusses evidence supporting the hypothesis that conditioned withdrawal facilitates memory consolidation by activating a neurocircuitry that involves the extended amygdala. Specifically, the central amygdala, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and the nucleus accumbens shell interact functionally during withdrawal, mediate expression of conditioned responses, and are implicated in memory consolidation. From this perspective, the extended amygdala could be a neural pathway by which drug-seeking behaviour performed during a state of conditioned withdrawal is more likely to become habitual and persistent.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry,08-Mar-22

There is yet to be a regulatory-approved treatment. Emerging preclinical evidence indicates that deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus accumbens may be a therapeutic option. Prior to expanding the costly investigation of DBS for treatment of CUD, it is important to ensure societal cost-effectiveness. Aim(s): We conducted a threshold and cost-effectiveness analysis to determine the success rate at which DBS would be equivalent to contingency management (CM), recently identified as the most efficacious therapy for treatments of CUDs. Material(s) and Method(s): Quality of life, efficacy, and safety parameters for CM were obtained from previous literature. Costs were calculated from a societal perspective. Our model predicted the utility benefit based on quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental-cost-effectiveness ratio resulting from two treatments on a one-, two-, and five-year timeline. Result(s): On a one-year timeline, DBS would need to impart a success rate (ie, cocaine free) of 70% for it to yield the same utility benefit (0.492 QALYs per year) as CM. At no success rate would DBS be more cost-effective (incremental-cost-effectiveness ratio <$50,000) than CM during the first year. Nevertheless, as DBS costs are front loaded, DBS would need to achieve success rates of 74% and 51% for its cost-effectiveness to exceed that of CM over a two- and five-year period, respectively. Conclusion(s): We find DBS would not be cost-effective in the short term (one year) but may be cost-effective in longer timelines. Since DBS holds promise to potentially be a cost-effective treatment for CUDs, future randomized controlled trials should be performed to assess its efficacy.Copyright © 2021 International Neuromodulation Society",Neuromodulation,Feb-22

WHOQOL-BREF","Background and rationale. Severe alcohol use disorder (SAUD) is a major public health concern, given its massive individual, interpersonal, and societal consequences. The available prevention and treatment programs have proven limited effectiveness, as relapse rates are still high in this clinical population. Developing effective interventions reducing the appearance and persistence of SAUD thus constitutes an experimental and clinical priority. Among the new therapeutic approaches, there is a growing interest for noninvasive neuromodulation techniques, and particularly for transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) as an adjunctive treatment in neuropsychiatric disorders, including SAUD. Methods. We propose a systematic review, based on preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, evaluating the available evidence on the effectiveness of tDCS to improve clinical interventions in SAUD. Results. We provide an integrative overview of studies applying tDCS in clinical populations with SAUD, together with a standardized methodological quality assessment. We show that the currently available data remain inconsistent. Some data suggested that tDCS can (1) reduce craving, relapse or alcohol-cue reactivity and (2) improve cognitive control and inhibition. However, other studies did not observe any beneficial effect of tDCS in SAUD. Conclusions. Capitalizing on the identified strengths and shortcomings of available results, we present evidence-based clinical guidelines to integrate tDCS in current clinical settings and to combine it with neurocognitive training.Copyright © EEG and Clinical Neuroscience Society (ECNS) 2021.",Clinical EEG and Neuroscience,Jul-22

A crucial finding in the brain of these patients is increased extracellular concentrations of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc). Objective(s): To determine the efficacy and safety of NAcc surgery for the treatment of substance dependence. Material(s) and Method(s): Adhering to PRISMA guidelines, we performed a systematic review to identify all original studies in which NAcc surgery was performed to treat relapsing drug addiction with a minimum follow-up of six months. From database inception to April 10, 2020, we searched PubMed, Scopus, and LILACS. Two reviewers independently selected studies and extracted data. The main outcome was the relapse rate. The GRADE methods were applied to evaluate the quality of evidence. This study was registered with PROSPERO CRD42020177054. Result(s): Fifteen studies involving 359 participants met inclusion criteria; eight (56%) included NAcc deep brain stimulation (DBS) in 13 patients with addiction for alcohol (N = 6, 46.1%), opioid (N = 4, 30.7%), and nicotine (N = 3, 15.3%); seven studies (N = 346, 44%) performed NAcc radiofrequency (RF) ablation for opioid (N = 334) and alcohol (N = 12) dependence. Relapse rates were 38.4% for DBS and 39% for RF ablation. Conclusion(s): Despite available studies reporting a benefit in the treatment of drug addictions with NAcc surgery, this systematic review stresses the need for carefully planned prospective studies in order to further address the efficacy and indications.Copyright © 2021",Neuromodulation,Feb-22

Conservative treatment to achieve abstinence consists of detoxification combined with psychotherapy and the use of drugs, but it is estimated that only half of the individuals achieve long-term abstinence with the available treatments. In this sense, neurosurgery appears as a therapeutic proposal. The present study aimed to gather information about the circuitry related to alcohol use disorder (AUD), to describe possible surgical targets, and to establish whether a surgical approach could be a safe and effective treatment option. A systematic review of the literature was conducted and reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. The 14 selected articles analyze ablative operations, deep brain stimulation (DBS), and a new procedure in which the patient is first submitted to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation to evaluate their response, and later an implant is surgically positioned on the evaluated target to obtain more lasting results. The most relevant outcomes were found when the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) were used as targets, demonstrating a large reduction in alcohol intake and even its cessation. However, important side effects were observed, such as psychotic symptoms, right frontal venous infarction, seizures after implantation in the ACC and a hypomanic period after DBS in the NAcc, which could be reversed. Due to the lack of studies involving the surgical treatment of AUD, more clinical trials are needed to compare targets, to assess surgical techniques, and to estimate the safety of these techniques.Copyright © 2022.

transcranial magnetic stimulation","Individuals with schizophrenia are 10 times more likely to have a tobacco use disorder than the general population. Up to 80% of those with schizophrenia smoke tobacco regularly, a prevalence three-times that of the general population. Despite the striking prevalence of tobacco use in schizophrenia, current treatments are not tailored to the pathophysiology of this population. There is growing support for use of noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) to treat substance use disorders (SUDs), particularly for tobacco use in neurotypical smokers. NIBS interventions targeting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex have been effective for nicotine dependence in control populations-so much so that transcranial magnetic stimulation is now FDA-approved for smoking cessation. However, this has not borne out in the studies using this approach in schizophrenia. We performed a literature search to identify articles using NIBS for the treatment of nicotine dependence in people with schizophrenia, which identified six studies. These studies yielded mixed results. Is it possible that nicotine has a unique effect in schizophrenia that is different than its effect in neurotypical smokers? Individuals with schizophrenia may receive additional benefit from nicotine's pro-cognitive effects than control populations and may use nicotine to improve brain network abnormalities from their illness. Therefore, clinical trials of NIBS interventions should test a schizophrenia-specific target for smoking cessation. We propose a generalized approach whereby schizophrenia-specific brain circuitry related to SUDs is be identified and then targeted with NIBS interventions.Copyright © 2022 Ward, Brady, Halko and Lizano.",Frontiers in Psychiatry,09-Feb-22

Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) have yielded mixed effects on risk-taking among healthy controls. Given the importance of risk-taking behaviors among substance-using samples, this study aimed to examine the effects of tDCS on risk-taking among a sample of adults using cannabis. Using a double-blind design, 27 cannabis users [M(SD) age = 32.48 (1.99), 41% female] were randomized, receiving one session of active or sham tDCS over the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Stimulation parameters closely followed prior studies with anodal right dlPFC and cathodal left dlPFC stimulation. Risk-taking-assessed via a modified Cambridge Gambling Task-was measured before and during tDCS. Delay and probability discounting tasks were assessed before and after stimulation. No significant effects of stimulation on risk-taking behavior were found. However, participants chose the less risky option ~86% of the trials before stimulation which potentially contributed to ceiling effects. These results contradict one prior study showing increased risk-taking among cannabis users following tDCS. There was a significant increase in delay discounting of a $1000 delayed reward during stimulation for the sham group only, but no significant effects for probability discounting. The current study adds to conflicting and inconclusive literature on tDCS and cognition among substance-using samples. In conclusion, results suggest the ineffectiveness of single session dlPFC tDCS using an established stimulation protocol on risk-taking, although ceiling effects at baseline may have also prevented behavior change following tDCS.Copyright © 2022 Patel, Naish, Soreni and Amlung.",Frontiers in Human Neuroscience,08-Feb-22

Review

transcranial direct current stimulation

transcranial magnetic stimulation","Substance and behavioral addiction is a global health problem related to cognitive functioning and emotional responses like top-down control and craving. The present review discusses the role of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) as evidence-based treatments for addiction disorders. The discussion spans between several evidence for both therapies, also considering the difference and heterogeneity among clinical protocols. Nowadays, literature is consistent in indicating the neurostimulation of the prefrontal cortex as effective for different kinds of addiction, corroborating the evidence that they rely on a common network in the brain. Likewise, within the CBT studies it is possible to observe a wide range of interventions that are overall effective in regulating the executive functions associated with addiction disorders. Nevertheless, the integration of NIBS and CBT in addictions has been scarcely considered in literature so far. For this reason, the present article is meant to foster empirical research in this field by highlighting the findings supporting these evidence-based interventions, both as stand-alone and integrated treatments. To this aim, psychological and neurophysiological mechanisms of NIBS and CBT in addictions are reviewed, and the rationale of their integration discussed. In particular, as evidence suggest these treatments affect top-down and bottom-up processes in different ways, with NIBS reducing craving and CBT boosting motivation and coping, we suggest their combination might better target the different components of addiction to promote abstinence.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Neuroscience Letters,23-Apr-22

The process is triggered by the presentation of retrieval cues (reminders of the memory to be reactivated). However, reconsolidation is not universally triggered upon retrieval. Here we investigate one boundary condition thought to constrain memory reactivation: retrieval length. We also investigate the effects of a novel post-retrieval manipulation: intentional suppression. We assessed this with the think/no-think (TNT) task, in a clinically relevant sample of hazardous drinkers, using alcohol-related paired associate learning. 73 participants took part in four online sessions. On the first session participants were required to learn 36 image-word pairs. On the second session participants received 0, 4, 18 or 36 retrieval cues followed by the TNT task. The recall of the pairs was assessed 2 and 7 days after the retrieval + TNT procedure. The 4-trial retrieval procedure was the most consistent with triggering memory reconsolidation. This group showed greater practice effects and was the only group in which suppression-induced forgetting was observed at test. However, suppression-induced forgetting of alcohol cues was lower than in normative samples, indicating that intentional forgetting effects may depend upon population, salience of material and time between suppression and retrieval.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Behaviour Research and Therapy,May-22

transcranial direct current stimulation","Background: Maladaptive neuroplasticity-related learned response in substance use disorder (SUD) can be ameliorated using noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS); however, inter-individual variability needs to be addressed for clinical translation. Objective(s): Our first objective was to develop a hypothesis for NIBS for learned response in SUD based on a competing neurobehavioral decision systems model. The next objective was to develop the theory by conducting a computational simulation of NIBS of the cortico-cerebello-thalamo-cortical (CCTC) loop in cannabis use disorder (CUD)-related dysfunctional ""cue-reactivity""-a construct closely related to ""craving""-that is a core symptom. Our third objective was to test the feasibility of a neuroimaging-guided rational NIBS approach in healthy humans. Method(s): ""Cue-reactivity"" can be measured using behavioral paradigms and portable neuroimaging, including functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electroencephalogram (EEG) metrics of sensorimotor gating. Therefore, we conducted a computational simulation of NIBS, including transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) of the cerebellar cortex and deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) of the CCTC loop for its postulated effects on fNIRS and EEG metrics. We also developed a rational neuroimaging-guided NIBS approach for the cerebellar lobule (VII) and prefrontal cortex based on a healthy human study. Result(s): Simulation of cerebellar tDCS induced gamma oscillations in the cerebral cortex, while transcranial temporal interference stimulation induced a gamma-to-beta frequency shift. A preliminary healthy human study (N = 10) found that 2 mA cerebellar tDCS evoked similar oxyhemoglobin (HbO) response in the range of 5 x 10-6 M across the cerebellum and PFC brain regions (alpha = 0.01); however, infra-slow (0.01-0.10 Hz) prefrontal cortex HbO-driven phase-amplitude-coupled (PAC; 4 Hz, +/-2 mA (max)) cerebellar tACS evoked HbO levels in the range of 10-7 M that were statistically different (alpha = 0.01) across these brain regions. Conclusion(s): Our healthy human study showed the feasibility of fNIRS of cerebellum and PFC and closed-loop fNIRS-driven ctACS at 4 Hz, which may facilitate cerebellar cognitive function via the frontoparietal network. Future work needs to combine fNIRS with EEG for multi-modal imaging for closed-loop NIBS during operant conditioning.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

Standardized image sets are used, but the effect of viewing people interacting with the alcohol drink remains unclear, which is associated with the factors of alcohol cues that influence the degree of response to alcohol stimuli. The present study used fMRI to investigate the reactivity of alcohol dependence (AD) inpatients to alcohol cues with or without human drinking behavior. Cues with a human interacting with a drink were hypothesized to increase sensorimotor activation. In total, 30 AD inpatients were asked to view pictures with a factorial design of beverage types (alcoholic vs. non-alcoholic beverages) and cue types (with or without drink action). Whole-brain analyses were performed. A correlation analysis was conducted to confirm whether the whole-brain analysis revealed cue-related brain activations correlated with problem drinking duration. The left lingual gyrus showed significant beverage types through cue type interaction, and the bilateral temporal cortex showed significant activation in response to alcohol cues depicting human drinking behavior. The right and left lingual gyrus regions and left temporal cortex were positively correlated with problem drinking duration. Sensorimotor activations in the temporal cortex may reflect self-referential and memory-based scene processing. Thus, our findings indicate these regions are associated with alcohol use and suggest them for cue exposure treatment of alcohol addiction.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

schizophrenia","Reward Deficiency Syndrome (RDS) encompasses many mental health disorders, including a wide range of addictions and compulsive and impulsive behaviors. Described as an octopus of behavioral dysfunction, RDS refers to abnormal behavior caused by a breakdown of the cascade of reward in neurotransmission due to genetic and epigenetic influences. The resultant reward neurotransmission deficiencies interfere with the pleasure derived from satisfying powerful human physiological drives. Epigenetic repair may be possible with precision gene-guided therapy using formulations of KB220, a nutraceutical that has demonstrated pro-dopamine regulatory function in animal and human neuroimaging and clinical trials. Recently, large GWAS studies have revealed a significant dopaminergic gene risk polymorphic allele overlap between depressed and schizophrenic cohorts. A large volume of literature has also identified ADHD, PTSD, and spectrum disorders as having the known neurogenetic and psychological underpinnings of RDS. The hypothesis is that the true phenotype is RDS, and behavioral disorders are endophenotypes. Is it logical to wonder if RDS exists everywhere? Although complex, ""the answer is blowin' in the wind,"" and rather than intangible, RDS may be foundational in species evolution and survival, with an array of many neurotransmitters and polymorphic loci influencing behavioral functionality.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

young adult","Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of structures in the brain's reward system is a promising therapeutic option for patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Recently, DBS of the habenula (HB) in the brain's anti-reward system has also been reported to alleviate depressive symptoms in patients with TRD or bipolar disorder (BD). In this pilot open-label prospective study, we explored the safety and clinical effectiveness of HB-DBS treatment in seven patients with TRD or BD. Also, local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded from the patients' left and right HB to explore the power and asymmetry of oscillatory activities as putative biomarkers of the underlying disease state. At 1-month follow-up (FU), depression and anxiety symptoms were both reduced by 49% (n = 7) along with substantial improvements in patients' health status, functional impairment, and quality of life. Although the dropout rate was high and large variability in clinical response existed, clinical improvements were generally maintained throughout the study [56%, 46%, and 64% reduction for depression and 61%, 48%, and 70% reduction for anxiety at 3-month FU (n = 5), 6-month FU (n = 5), and 12-month FU (n = 3), respectively]. After HB-DBS surgery, sustained improvements in mania symptoms were found in two patients who presented with mild hypomania at baseline. Another patient, however, experienced an acute manic episode 2 months after surgery that required hospitalization. Additionally, weaker and more symmetrical HB LFP oscillatory activities were associated with more severe depression and anxiety symptoms at baseline, in keeping with the hypothesis that HB dysfunction contributes to MDD pathophysiology. These preliminary findings indicate that HB-DBS may offer a valuable treatment option for depressive symptoms in patients who suffer from TRD or BD. Larger and well-controlled studies are warranted to examine the safety and efficacy of HB-DBS for treatment-refractory mood disorders in a more rigorous fashion.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s).",Translational Psychiatry,Dec-22

vagus nerve stimulation","The mainstay of treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) is opioid agonist therapy (OAT), which modulates opioid receptors to reduce substance craving and use. OAT maintains dependence on opioids but helps reduce overdose and negative sequelae of substance abuse. Despite increasing availability of OAT, its effectiveness is limited by difficulty in initiating and maintaining patients on treatment. With the worsening opioid epidemic in the United States and rising overdose deaths, a more durable and effective treatment for OUD is necessary. This paper reviews novel treatments being investigated for OUD, including neuromodulatory interventions, psychedelic drugs, and other novel approaches. Neuromodulatory interventions can stimulate the addiction neural circuitry involving the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and deeper mesolimbic structures to curb craving and reduce use, and multiple clinical trials for interventional treatment for OUD are currently conducted. Similarly, psychedelic agents are being investigated for efficacy in OUD specifically. There is a resurgence of interest in psychedelic agents' therapeutic potential, with evidence of improving mood symptoms and decreased substance use even after just one dose. Exact mechanism of their anti-addictive effect is not fully elucidated, but psychedelic agents do not maintain opioid dependence and some may even be helpful in abating symptoms of withdrawal. Other potential approaches for OUD include targeting different parts of the dopamine-dependent addiction pathway, identifying susceptible genes and modulating gene products, as well as utilizing vaccines as immunotherapy to blunt the addictive effects of substances. Much more clinical data are needed to support efficacy and safety of these therapies in OUD, but these proposed novel treatments look beyond the opioid receptor to offer hope for a more durably effective OUD treatment.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Journal of the Neurological Sciences,15-Jan-22

This comorbidity is known to confer worse outcomes and greater illness severity. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive neuromodulation method that has demonstrated antidepressant effects. However, the study of rTMS for patients with MDD and commonly associated comorbidities, such as AUD, has been largely overlooked, despite significant overlap in clinical presentation and neurobiological mechanisms. This narrative review aims to highlight the interrelated aspects of the literature on rTMS for MDD and rTMS for AUD. First, we summarize the available evidence on the effectiveness of rTMS for each condition, both most studied through stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Second, we describe common symptom constructs that can be modulated by rTMS, such as executive dysfunction, that are transdiagnostic across these disorders. Lastly, we describe promising approaches in the personalization and optimization of rTMS that may be applicable to both AUD and MDD. By bridging the gap between research efforts in MDD and AUD, rTMS is well positioned to be developed as a treatment for the many patients who have both conditions concurrently.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

Each approach has a different profile of advantages and disadvantages. However, many psychiatrists, ethicists, and laypeople are sceptical about psychiatric neurosurgery. Method(s): We identify the main concerns against psychiatric neurosurgery, and discuss the extent to which they are justified and how they might be overcome. We review the evidence for the effectiveness, efficacy and safety of each approach, and discuss how this could be improved. We analyse whether and, if so, how randomised controlled trials (RCTs) can be used in the different approaches, and what alternatives are available if conducting RCTs is impossible for practical or ethical reasons. Specifically, we analyse the problem of failed RCTs after promising open-label studies. Result(s): The main concerns are: (i) reservations based on historical psychosurgery, (ii) concerns about personality changes, (iii) concerns regarding localised interventions, and (iv) scepticism due to the lack of scientific evidence. Given the need for effective therapies for treatment-refractory psychiatric disorders and preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of psychiatric neurosurgery, further research is warranted and necessary. Since psychiatric neurosurgery has the potential to modify personality traits, it should be held to the highest ethical and scientific standards. Conclusion(s): Psychiatric neurosurgery procedures with preliminary evidence for efficacy and an acceptable risk-benefit profile include DBS and micro- or radiosurgical anterior capsulotomy for intractable obsessive-compulsive disorder. These methods may be considered for individual treatment attempts, but multi-centre RCTs are necessary to provide reliable evidence.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s).",Neuroethics,Apr-22

Objective(s): To report motor and non-motor symptoms after 5-years of STN-DBS. Method(s): We performed an open 5-year extension study of a randomized trial that compared intraoperative verification versus mapping of STN using microelectrode recordings. Changes from preoperative to 5-years of STN-DBS were evaluated for motor and non-motor symptoms (MDS-UPDRS I-IV), sleep disturbances (PDSS), autonomic symptoms (Scopa-Aut), quality of life (PDQ-39) and cognition through a neuropsychological test battery. We evaluated whether any differences between the two randomization groups were still present, and assessed preoperative predictors of physical dependence after 5 years of treatment using logistic regression. Result(s): We found lasting improvement of off-medication motor symptoms (total MDS-UPDRS III, bradykinetic-rigid symptoms and tremor), on-medication tremor, motor fluctuations, and sleep disturbances, but reduced performance across all cognitive domains, except verbal memory. Reduction of verbal fluency and executive function was most pronounced the first year and may thus be more directly related to the surgery than worsening in other domains. The group mapped with multiple microelectrode recordings had more improvement of bradykinetic-rigid symptoms and of PDQ-39 bodily discomfort sub-score, but also more reduction in word fluency. Older age was the most important factor associated with physical dependence after 5 years. Conclusion(s): STN-DBS offers good long-term effects, including improved sleep, despite disease progression. STN-DBS surgery may negatively impact verbal fluency and executive function.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

We aimed to assess its effectiveness for long-term smoking cessation. METHOD(S): Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCT). PubMed, Cochrane library, Embase, PsycINFO and clinical trials registries were systematically searched for relevant studies up to May 2021. Relevant studies included adult smokers seeking smoking cessation, included in an RCT using NIBS [specifically repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)], and with follow-up of more than 4weeks. There were no restrictions on location. Abstinence rates in the active NIBS groups were compared with abstinence rates in sham NIBS or in usual treatment groups, from 4weeks to 12months following the quit attempt. Smoking abstinence was measured on an intention-to-treat basis and we used risk ratios (RRs) as measures of effect size. RESULT(S): Seven studies were included (n=699 patients). In all included studies, the control groups were receiving sham NIBS and only data from 3 to 6 months were analysable. By pooling the seven included studies, the RR of sustained abstinence of any form of NIBS relative to sham NIBS was 2.39 [95% confidence interval (CI)=1.26-4.55; I2 =40%]. Subgroup analyses found that the RR was even higher when excitatory rTMS was used on the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (RR=4.34; 95% CI=1.69-11.18; I2 =0%) or when using deep rTMS targeting the lateral prefrontal cortex and insula bilaterally (RR=4.64; 95% CI=1.61-13.39; I2 =0%). A high risk of bias was found in four included studies. We also determined, using grades of recommendation, assessment, development and evaluation, that overall there was a low level of confidence in the results. CONCLUSION(S): Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) may improve smoking abstinence rates from 3 to 6 months after quitting smoking, compared with sham NIBS or usual treatment.Copyright © 2022 Society for the Study of Addiction.","Addiction (Abingdon, England)",01-Nov-22

However, it is unclear whether these intervention effects are maintained over time. This study aimed to measure the immediate, short- and long-term effects of excitatory transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) targeting at dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in people with drug addiction or overeating. METHOD(S): A systematic review and random effects meta-analysis. We included 20 articles (total of 22 studies using randomized controlled trials: 3 alcohol dependence, 3 drug dependence, 12 smoking, 4 overeating; total: 720 participants) from January 2000 to June 2020, which reported at least one follow-up assessment of craving, consumption or abstinence levels after the intervention. We compared effects of active versus sham stimulation immediately after the intervention and at the last follow-up assessment, as compared with baseline. RESULT(S): Excitatory neuromodulation of dlPFC activity reduced craving and consumption immediately after the intervention (craving: g=0.734, CI = 0.447-1.021, P<0.001; consumption: g=0.527, CI = 0.309-0.745; P<0.001), as well as during short-, mid- and long-term abstinence (craving: g=0.677, CI = 0.440-0.914, P<0.001; consumption: g=0.445, CI = 0.245-0.645, P<0.001; abstinence levels: g=0.698, CI = 0.433-0.963, P<0.001; average time of follow-up: 84+/-83days after last stimulation). Additional analysis demonstrated that the intervention effects were sustained in all populations studied (food, nicotine, alcohol or drug abuse) and with both stimulation techniques used (rTMS, tDCS). Interventions targeting at the left (vs right) hemisphere may be more effective. CONCLUSION(S): Excitatory neuromodulation targeting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex appears to lead to a sustained reduction of craving and consumption in individuals with addiction or overeating behaviour.Copyright © 2021 Society for the Study of Addiction.","Addiction (Abingdon, England)",01-May-22

A crucial finding in the brain of these patients is increased extracellular concentrations of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc). OBJECTIVE(S): To determine the efficacy and safety of NAcc surgery for the treatment of substance dependence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adhering to PRISMA guidelines, we performed a systematic review to identify all original studies in which NAcc surgery was performed to treat relapsing drug addiction with a minimum follow-up of sixmonths. From database inception to April 10, 2020, we searched PubMed, Scopus, and LILACS. Two reviewers independently selected studies and extracted data. The main outcome was the relapse rate. The GRADE methods were applied to evaluate the quality of evidence. This study was registered with PROSPERO CRD42020177054. RESULT(S): Fifteen studies involving 359 participants met inclusion criteria; eight (56%) included NAcc deep brain stimulation (DBS) in 13 patients with addiction for alcohol (N = 6, 46.1%), opioid (N = 4, 30.7%), and nicotine (N = 3, 15.3%); seven studies (N = 346, 44%) performed NAcc radiofrequency (RF) ablation for opioid (N = 334) and alcohol (N = 12) dependence. Relapse rates were 38.4% for DBS and 39% for RF ablation. CONCLUSION(S): Despite available studies reporting a benefit in the treatment of drug addictions with NAcc surgery, this systematic review stresses the need for carefully planned prospective studies in order to further address the efficacy and indications.Copyright © 2021.

vagus nerve stimulation","More than any other brain region, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) gives rise to the singularity of human experience. It is therefore frequently implicated in the most distinctly human of all disorders, those of mental health. Noninvasive neuromodulation, including electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) among others, can-unlike pharmacotherapy-directly target the PFC and its neural circuits. Direct targeting enables significantly greater on-target therapeutic effects compared with off-target adverse effects. In contrast to invasive neuromodulation approaches, such as deep-brain stimulation (DBS), noninvasive neuromodulation can reversibly modulate neural activity from outside the scalp. This combination of direct targeting and reversibility enables noninvasive neuromodulation to iteratively change activity in the PFC and its neural circuits to reveal causal mechanisms of both disease processes and healthy function. When coupled with neuronavigation and neurophysiological readouts, noninvasive neuromodulation holds promise for personalizing PFC neuromodulation to relieve symptoms of mental health disorders by optimizing the function of the PFC and its neural circuits.

To investigate the effects of Shenmen (HT7) acupoint on brain activation induced by cue-elicited alcohol craving, 30 right-handed healthy light to moderate alcohol drinkers were recruited from the community. They were randomly assigned to undergo acupuncture either at HT7 (experimental acupoint, n = 15) or Jingqu (LU8, control acupoint, n = 15) acupoints. This randomized controlled study was performed in Daegu Haany University and Daegu-Gyeongbuk Medical Innovation Foundation, Republic of Korea. Recruitment and data collection were conducted from December 2018 to May 2019. The results showed that after acupuncture at HT7 acupoint, the activation of orbitofrontal cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was greatly increased, while the activation of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was obviously reduced, and subject's craving for alcohol was reduced when he/she seeing alcohol-related video clips involving various alcohols (beer, wine, or soju) or drinking scenarios. Acupuncture at HT7 more greatly reduced subject's alcohol cravings than acupuncture at LU8 acupoint. These findings suggest that acupuncture can improve the self-control of mild to moderate social drinkers through the activation of the orbitofrontal cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, thereby reducing the craving for alcohol. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Daegu Haany University Korean Medicine Hospital, Republic of Korea (approval No. DHUMC-D-18026-PRO-02) on November 30, 2018.Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

*total hip replacement","Opioid misuse and overdose have become a public health hazard and caused drug addiction and death in the United States due to rapid increase in prescribed and non-prescribed opioid usage. The misuse and overdose are highly related to opioid over-prescription for chronic and acute pain treatment, where a one-size-fits-all prescription plan is often adopted but can lead to substantial leftovers for patients who only consume a few. To reduce over-prescription and opioid overdose, each patient's opioid usage pattern should be taken into account. As opioids are often prescribed for patients after total joint replacement surgeries, this study introduces a machine learning model to predict each patient's opioid usage level in the first 2 weeks after discharge. Specifically, the electronic health records, patient prescription history, and consumption survey data are collected to investigate the level of short-term opioid usage after joint replacement surgeries. However, there are a considerable number of answers missing in the surveys, which degrades data quality. To overcome this difficulty, a semi-supervised learning model that assigns pseudo labels via Bayesian regression is proposed. Using this model, the missing survey answers of opioids amount taken by the patients are predicted first. Then, based on the prediction, pseudo labels are assigned to those patients to improve classification performance. Extensive experiments indicate that such a semi-supervised learning model has shown a better performance in the resulting patients classification. It is expected that by using such a model the providers can adjust the amount of prescribed opioids to meet each patient's actual need, which can benefit the management of opioid prescription and pain intervention.Copyright © 2013 IEEE.",IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,Jan-21

*tobacco dependence / *drug therapy","Substance abuse is a fundamentally dynamic disease, characterized by repeated oscillation between craving, drug self-administration, reward, and satiety. To model nicotine addiction as a control system, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-compatible nicotine delivery system is needed to elicit cyclical cravings. Using a concentric nebulizer, inserted into one nostril, we delivered each dose equivalent to a single cigarette puff by a syringe pump. A control mechanism permits dual modes: one delivers puffs on a fixed interval programmed by researchers; with the other, subjects press a button to self-administer each nicotine dose. We tested the viability of this delivery method for studying the brain's response to nicotine addiction in three steps. First, we established the pharmacokinetics of nicotine delivery, using a dosing scheme designed to gradually achieve saturation. Second, we lengthened the time between microdoses to elicit craving cycles, using both fixed-interval and subject-driven behavior. Finally, we demonstrate a potential application of our device by showing that a fixed-interval protocol can reliably identify neuromodulatory targets for pharmacotherapy or brain stimulation. Our MRI-compatible nasal delivery method enables the measurement of neural circuit responses to drug doses on a single-subject level, allowing the development of data-driven predictive models to quantify individual dysregulations of the reward control circuit causing addiction.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

It reviews the role of cannabis in the treatment of chronic pain, cognitive and neurological adverse effects, special cases and addiction. Recent Findings: Cannabinoids work through the endocannabinoids system and inhibit the release of GABA and glutamate in the brain, impact neuromodulation, as well as dopamine, acetylcholine and norepinephrine release. They affect reward, learning and pain. The use of cannabis is increasing nationally and world-wide for both recreational and medicinal purposes, however, there is relatively only low quality evidence to the efficacy and adverse effects of this. Cannabis and its derivatives may be used for treatment of chronic pain. They are via CB1 receptors that are thought to modulate nociceptive signals in the brain. CB2 receptors in the DRG likely affect pain integration in the afferent pathways, and peripherally CB2 also affects noradrenergic pathways influencing pain. A large proportion of users may see more than 50% of chronic pain alleviation compared with placebo. Cannabis affects cognition, most notably executive function, memory and attention, and may deteriorate the boundary between emotional and executive processing. Cannabis impairs memory in the short run, which become more significant with chronic use, and may also be accompanied by poorer effort, slower processing and impacted attention. It is generally believed that long-term use and earlier age are risk factor for neurocognitive deficits; neuroimaging studies have shown reduced hippocampal volume and density. Executive functions and memory are worse in adolescent users versus adults. Cannabis addiction is different and likely less common than other addictive substances, but up to 10% of users meet criteria for lifetime cannabis dependence. Addiction patterns may be linked to genetic and epigenetic differences. It is still unclear whether abstinence reverses patterns of addiction, and more research is required into this topic. Summary: Cannabis use has become more abundant for both medical and recreational use. It carries likely benefits in the form of analgesia, anti-emesis and improved appetite in chronic patients. The evidence reviewing adverse effects of this use are still limited, however, exiting data points to a clear link with neurocognitive deterioration, backed by loss of brain volume and density. Addiction is likely complex and variable, and no good data exists to support treatment at this point. It is becoming clear that use in earlier ages carries a higher risk for long-term deficits. As with any other drug, these risks should be considered alongside benefits prior to a decision on cannabis use.Copyright © 2021, MedWorks Media LLC.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an emerging therapeutic strategy relating to changes in brain activity. It stimulates the prefrontal cortex and is involved in inhibitory cognitive control, decision making and care. This systematic review aims to evaluate and synthesize the evidence on the safety, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of rTMS for the treatment of cocaine ad-diction. A systematic review of the literature was carried out. The following electronic databases were consulted from inception to October 2020: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Web of Science. Randomised controlled trials, non-randomised controlled trials and case-series and full economic evaluations were included. Twelve studies were included. No identified study reported data on cost-effectiveness. Significant results of the efficacy of TMS have been observed in terms of the reduction of craving to consume and the number of doses consumed. No serious adverse effects have been observed. Despite the low quality of the studies, the first results were observed in terms of reduction of cocaine use and craving. In any case, this effect is considered moderate. Studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow-ups are required.Copyright © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Journal of Clinical Medicine,December-1 2021

Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale","Introduction: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) uses magnetic pulses to induce electrical current in the underlying neuronal tissue. A variety of TMS coils exist on the market, differing primarily in configuration, orientation, and flexibility of the wire windings of the coil. Deep TMSTM utilizes H-Coils, flexible coils with different configurations for stimulating different brain regions implicated in different neuropsychiatric disorders. The H7 Coil, designed to target primarily the medial prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex, is FDA-cleared for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). It was chosen as the focus of this review since it recently showed promise in various neuropsychiatric populations in addition to growing understanding of its mechanism of action (MOA). Areas covered: Here we assembled all peer-reviewed publications on the H7 Coil to showcase its efficacy in: (a) various OCD patient populations (e.g., different degrees of symptom severity, treatment resistance, comorbidities) (b) other neuropsychiatric populations (e.g., addiction, major depressive disorder and autism spectrum disorder). Expert opinion: While substantial evidence pertaining to the H7 Coil's efficacy as well as its MOA has accumulated, much work remains. In the final section of this review, we highlight areas of ongoing and future research that will further elucidate the coil's MOA as well as its full efficacy potential.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale","Background: While case series have established the efficacy of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in treating obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), it has been our experience that few OCD patients present without comorbidities that affect outcomes associated with DBS treatment. Here we present our experience with DBS therapy for OCD in patients who all have comorbid disease, together with the results of our programming strategies. Method(s): For this case series, we assessed five patients who underwent ventral capsule/ventral striatum (VC/VS) DBS for OCD between 2015 and 2019 at the University of Colorado Hospital. Every patient in this cohort exhibited comorbidities, including substance use disorders, eating disorder, tic disorder, and autism spectrum disorder. We conducted an IRB-approved, retrospective study of programming modifications and treatment response over the course of DBS therapy. Result(s): In addition to patients' subjective reports of improvement, we observed significant improvement in the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (44%), the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (53%), the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (27%), and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating scales (34.9%) following DBS. With respect to co-morbid disease, there was a significant improvement in a patient with tic disorder's Total Tic Severity Score (TTSS) (p = 0.005). Conclusion(s): DBS remains an efficacious tool for the treatment of OCD, even in patients with significant comorbidities in whom DBS has not previously been investigated. Efficacious treatment results not only from the accurate placement of the electrodes by the surgeon but also from programming by the psychiatrist.© Copyright © 2021 Kahn, Sutton, Winston, Abosch, Thompson and Davis.",Frontiers in Psychiatry,24-Mar-21

Objective(s): We investigated the influence of the ECS on the intricate interplay between impulsiveness and compulsiveness. Method(s): We conducted a search in PubMed, PsyhInfo, and Scopus by using the keywords compulsiveness, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), impulsiveness, Impulse Control Disorders (ICDs), addiction, ECS, serotonin, and dopamine. Result(s): The ECS is famous for its role in motivational processes and reward signaling, contributing to the hedonic effect elicited by pleasurable activities. Impulsiveness involves an inability to delay pleasure; compulsiveness, in contrast, is associated with a postponement of present pleasure due to an increased sense of menace. Impulsiveness and compulsiveness work together to result in addiction. The manipulation of the ECS through pharmacological or genetic methods is effective on the manifestations of OCD, ICDs, and impulsiveness. The ECS is distributed throughout the basal ganglia, prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus and interacts with serotonergic, dopaminergic, noradrenergic, GABAergic, and glutamatergic neural circuits which are all involved in impulsive and compulsive symptomatology. The ECS or cannabinoids exhibit divergent effects depending on environmental conditions, dose, and duration of exposure. The endocannabinoids are retrograde messengers inhibiting the presynaptic neurons (causing a braking effect) and released ""on demand"", generating a fine-tuning adjustment of the neural activity. Conclusion(s): How impulsiveness and compulsiveness, two apparently opposite traits, interoperate might be accounted for by the specific functions of the ECS.Copyright © 2021 Bentham Science Publishers.",Current Psychiatry Research and Reviews,Aug-21

young adult","Background: Intermittent explosive disorder (IED) is a psychiatric disorder characterized by recurrent outbursts of aggressive behavior. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the posteromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (pHyp) is an alternative therapy for extreme cases and shows promising results. Intraoperative microdialysis can help elucidate the neurobiological mechanism of pHyp-DBS. We sought to evaluate efficacy and safety of pHyp-DBS using 8-contact directional leads in patients with refractory IED (rIED) and the accompanying changes in neurotransmitters. Method(s): This was a prospective study in which patients with a diagnosis of rIED were treated with pHyp-DBS for symptom alleviation. Bilateral pHyp-DBS was performed with 8-contact directional electrodes. Follow-up was performed at 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery. Result(s): Four patients (3 men, mean age 27 +/- 2.8 years) were included. All patients were diagnosed with rIED and severe intellectual disability. Two patients had congenital rubella, one had a co-diagnosis of infantile autism, and the fourth presented with drug-resistant epilepsy. There was a marked increase in the levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid and glycine during intraoperative stimulation. The average improvement in aggressive behavior in the last follow-up was 6 points (DELTA: 50%, P = 0.003) while also documenting an important improvement of the Short Form Health Survey in all domains except bodily pain. No adverse events associated with pHyp-DBS were observed. Conclusion(s): This is the first study to show the safety and beneficial effect of directional lead pHyp-DBS in patients with rIED and to demonstrate the corresponding mechanism of action through increases in gamma-aminobutyric acid and glycine concentration in the pHyp.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",World Neurosurgery,Nov-21

The secondary objective was to assess geographical variation in amphetamine-type stimulant use in Northern Rural, Northern Urban, Southern Rural and Southern Urban Areas of Ontario. Method(s): A retrospective cohort study on 32,674 adults receiving OAT from ~70 clinics was conducted between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2020, in Ontario, Canada. Patients were divided into four groups base on the proportion of positive urine drug screening results for amphetamine-type stimulants during treatment: group 1 (0-25%), group 2 (25-50%), group 3 (50-75%), and groups 4 (75-100%). A Fractional logistic regression model was used to evaluate differences over time in amphetamine-type stimulant use with urine drug screening results. A Cox Proportional Hazard Ratio model was used to calculate the impact of amphetamine-type stimulant use on retention in OAT and adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, drug use and clinical factors. Lastly, a logistic regression model was used on a subgroup of patients to assess the impact of geography on amphetamine-type stimulant use in Northern Rural, Northern Urban, Southern Rural and Southern Urban Areas of Ontario. Result(s): There were significant differences in amphetamine-type stimulant positive urine drug screening results year-over-year from 2015 to 2020. Significant differences were observed between amphetamine-type stimulant groups with regards to sociodemographic, clinical and drug use factors. Compared to those with no amphetamine-type stimulant use, the number of days retained in OAT treatment for amphetamine-type stimulant users was reduced (hazard ratio 1.19; 95% confidence interval = 1.07-1.17; p < 0.001). Lastly, an adjusted logistic regression model showed a significant increase in the likelihood of amphetamine-type stimulant use in Northern Rural regions compared to Southern Urban areas. Conclusion(s): There was a significant increase in amphetamine-type stimulant use among individuals in OAT from 2014 to 2020, associated with decreased OAT retention. Research is required to determine if tailored strategies specific to individuals in OAT who use amphetamine-type stimulants can improve OAT outcomes.Copyright © 2021 Morin, Vojtesek, Acharya and Marsh.",Frontiers in Psychiatry,20-Dec-21

*treatment resistant depression","Purpose: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a relatively new and still experimental treatment modality for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). There is preliminary evidence that stimulation of brain reward circuit structures or their connecting white matter bundles may exert an antidepressant effect. The main nucleus of the reward circuit is the nucleus accumbens (NAc), which plays a critical role in reward-seeking behavior, motivation, and addiction. Also, white matter bundles connecting different structures of the reward circuit have been studied clinically as targets for DBS, including the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) - a central component of the mesolimbic dopaminergic reward circuit. This review aims to present the clinical outcomes of MFB DBS for TRD. Views: The scientific literature was reviewed using the following keywords: 'DBS', 'major depressive disorders', 'TRD', and 'MFB'. The identified studies were assessed on the basis of patient characteristics, clinical outcomes, and adverse events related to DBS. The search revealed five open-label clinical case studies and four case reports reporting the cumulative number of 35 patients treated by MFB DBS for TRD. Conclusion(s): The current clinical data of MFB DBS are limited by small sample size and the small number of clinical open-label trials. There is an urgent need for more clinical trials targeting the MFB for TRD. The results obtained in these studies showed a very rapid antidepressant effect observed within one week after the start of stimulation. MFB DBS for TRD should be considered as a last resort treatment due to its invasive character. However, this treatment may be a promising alternative for TRD patients.Copyright © 2021 Termedia Publishing House Ltd.. All rights reserved.",Postepy Psychiatrii i Neurologii,2021

However, the relationships between resting-state alpha coherence and N2/P3 components associated with response inhibition and cognitive processes have not been investigated in addictive disorders. The present study investigated the relationships between alpha coherence during the resting state and N2/P3 components of event-related potentials during the Go/Nogo task in healthy controls (HCs) and patients with Internet gaming disorder (IGD). A total of 64 young adults (HC: n = 31; IGD: n = 33) participated in this study. Alpha coherence values at left fronto-central and bilateral centro-temporal electrode sites were significantly correlated with P3 latency in HCs, whereas inverse correlations were observed in patients with IGD. Furthermore, significant differences were observed in the correlation values between the groups. Our results suggest that patients with IGD lack dynamic interactions of functional connectivity between the fronto-centro-temporal regions during the resting state and the event-related potential (ERP) index during cognitive tasks. The findings of this study may have important implications for understanding the neurophysiological mechanisms linking resting-state EEG and task-related ERPs underlying IGD.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

United States","Background: Numerous neuromodulatory therapies are currently under investigation or in clinical use for the treatment of psychiatric conditions. Objective/hypothesis: We sought to catalogue past and present human research studies on psychiatric neuromodulation and identify relevant trends in this field. Method(s): ClinicalTrials.gov (https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/) and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (https://www.who.int/ictrp/en/) were queried in March 2020 for trials assessing the outcome of neuromodulation for psychiatric disorders. Relevant trials were categorized by variables such as neuromodulation modality, country, brain target, publication status, design, and funding source. Result(s): From 72,086 initial search results, 1252 unique trials were identified. The number of trials registered annually has consistently increased. Half of all trials were active and a quarter have translated to publications. The largest proportion of trials involved depression (45%), schizophrenia (18%), and substance use disorders (14%). Trials spanned 37 countries; China, the second largest contributor (13%) after the United States (28%), has increased its output substantially in recent years. Over 75% of trials involved non-convulsive non-invasive modalities (e.g., transcranial magnetic stimulation), while convulsive (e.g., electroconvulsive therapy) and invasive modalities (e.g., deep brain stimulation) were less represented. 72% of trials featured approved or cleared interventions. Characteristic inter-modality differences were observed with respect to enrollment size, trial design/phase, and funding. Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex accounted for over half of focal neuromodulation trial targets. The proportion of trials examining biological correlates of neuromodulation has increased. Conclusion(s): These results provide a comprehensive overview of the state of psychiatric neuromodulation research, revealing the growing scope and internationalism of this field.Copyright © 2021 The Authors",Brain Stimulation,01-Sep-21

Despite progress in reducing tobacco use through pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy smoking cessation interventions, additional treatment options are still needed to improve treatment effectiveness. As an adjunctive treatment, the US Food and Drug Administration recently cleared transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a noninvasive brain stimulation technique, as an aid for smoking cessation in adults. Given that most smoking cessation interventions occur in the primary care setting, this article aims to introduce TMS, to provide an overview of the evidence of TMS for smoking cessation, and to outline the procedures for implementing TMS in the primary care setting when referral to an interventional psychiatrist is not possible. With growing scientific evidence and increasing regulatory approval of TMS for smoking cessation, this novel treatment option is now available for patients who want to quit smoking but have been unsuccessful with pharmacologic approaches.Copyright © 2021",American Journal of Medicine,Nov-21

Although several studies have sought to investigate new TMS modalities for the treatment of various psychiatric disorders, no study has yet examined publication trends in research on TMS modalities for psychiatric disorders. This study investigated publication trends in TMS research for 13 psychiatric disorders, including addiction, dementia, major depressive disorder (MDD), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and schizophrenia, as well as 9 TMS modalities, including bilateral stimulation, deep TMS, high-frequency stimulation, low-frequency stimulation, and theta burst stimulation. Method(s): Articles published in PubMed from 1985 to 2019 were searched to determine the number of published articles for each year in each category using the ""Results by year"" tool from the PubMed database. Result(s): Over the past 30 years, an increasing number of articles were published regarding TMS research for the treatment of MDD, addiction, and dementia, which were among those most commonly investigated psychiatric disorders, whereas the number of articles addressing schizophrenia and OCD treated via TMS remained steady since 2015. Regarding TMS modalities, previous high-frequency stimulation, low-frequency stimulation, and bilateral stimulation were the most common topics, with research regarding deep TMS and theta burst stimulation having increased since 2000 and 2005, respectively. Conclusion(s): TMS applications are rapidly developing and becoming increasingly ubiquitous in various psychiatric disorders. Determining publication trends in TMS research can be a useful method for monitoring TMS research interests and applications of new TMS modalities for psychiatric disorders.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

validation process","The notion of food ""addiction"" often focuses on the overconsumption of sweet tasting foods or so-called sugar ""addiction"". In the extreme, some have suggested that sugar and sweet tastes elicit neural and behavioral responses analogous to those observed with drugs of abuse. These concepts are complicated by the decades long uncertainty surrounding the validity and reproducibility of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) methodologies used to characterize neurobiological pathways related to sugar and sweet taste stimuli. There are also questions of whether sweet taste or post-ingestion metabolic consequences of sugar intake would lead to addiction or excessive caloric intake. Here, we present a focused narrative review of literature related to the reward value of sweet taste which suggests that reward value can be confounded with the construct of ""addictive potential"". Our review seeks to clarify some key distinctions between these constructs and questions the applicability of the addiction construct to human over-eating behaviors. To adequately frame this broad discussion requires the flexibility offered by the narrative review paradigm. We present selected literature on: techniques used to link sugar and sweet tastes to addiction neurobiology and behaviors; sugar and sweet taste ""addiction""; the relationship of low calorie sweetener (LCS) intake to addictive behaviors and total calorie intake. Finally, we examined the reward value of sweet tastes and contrasted that with the literature describing addiction. The lack of reproducibility of fMRI data remains problematic for attributing a common neurobiological pathway activation of drugs and foods as conclusive evidence for sugar or sweet taste ""addiction"". Moreover, the complicated hedonics of sweet taste and reward value are suggested by validated population-level data which demonstrate that the consumption of sweet taste in the absence of calories does not increase total caloric intake. We believe the neurobiologies of reward value and addiction to be distinct and disagree with application of the addiction model to sweet food overconsumption. Most hypotheses of sugar ""addiction"" attribute the hedonics of sweet foods as the equivalent of ""addiction"". Further, when addictive behaviors and biology are critically examined in totality, they contrast dramatically from those associated with the desire for sweet taste. Finally, the evidence is strong that responses to the palatability of sweets rather than their metabolic consequences are the salient features for reward value. Thus, given the complexity of the controls of food intake in humans, we question the usefulness of the ""addiction"" model in dissecting the causes and effects of sweet food over-consumption.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

When co-occurring, the presence of one disorder typically negatively impacts the prognosis for the other. Given the clinical relevance, we sought to examine pharmacotherapies for co-occurring CUD and MDD. While multiple treatment options have been examined in the treatment of each condition individually, studies exploring pharmacological options for their comorbidity are fewer and not conclusive. Areas Covered: For this review, the authors searched the literature in PubMed using clinical query options for therapies and keywords relating to each condition. Then, they described potentially promising pharmacologic therapeutic options based on shared mechanisms between the two conditions and/or results from individual clinical trials conducted to date. Expert opinion: Medications like stimulants, dopamine (D3) receptors partial agonists or antagonists, antagonists of kappa opioid receptors, topiramate, and ketamine could be promising as there is significant overlap relating to reward deficiency models, antireward pathways, and altered glutamatergic systems. However, the available clinical literature on any one of these types of agents is mixed. Additionally, for some agents there is possible concern related to abuse potential (e.g. ketamine and stimulants).Copyright © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Expert Opinion on Pharmacotherapy,2021

It is of central relevance to the neuropsychological construct of inhibition, as well as the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the STN (STN-DBS) is an established surgical treatment for PD that can be complicated by adverse neuropsychiatric side effects, most commonly characterized by impulsivity and mood elevation, although depression, anxiety, apathy, and cognitive changes have also been reported. Notwithstanding these adverse neuropsychiatric effects in PD, STN-DBS may also have a role in the treatment of refractory psychiatric disorders, as more is understood about the physiology of this nucleus and techniques in neuromodulation are refined. In this chapter, we link neuropsychiatric symptoms after STN-DBS for PD to the biological effects of electrode implantation, neurostimulation, and adjustments to dopaminergic medication, in the setting of neurodegeneration affecting cortico-striatal connectivity. We then provide an overview of clinical trials that have employed STN-DBS to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder and discuss future directions for subthalamic neuromodulation in psychiatry.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Review","The review presents data on the expression of growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1a (GHS-R1a) in the brain regions in model animals (zebrafish, rodents, primates), and in the human brain. Studies show widespread distribution of the receptor in the brain, which evidences the involvement of the receptor in many physiological processes. Using various organisms, data have been obtained regarding the participation of the GHS-R1a in the regulation of the anti- and pro-inflammatory response, proliferation, and apoptosis. It is known that the receptor plays an important role in eating behavior and is also involved in the pathogenetic mechanisms of drug addiction, obesity, and chronic alcohol consumption. Based on this, research is underway with the use of various therapeutic agents that can be used for the pharmacological correction of these conditions. This review also presents hypothetical pathways of intracellular signaling, in which GHS-R1a may participate. A complete understanding of these mechanisms has not yet been reached. The ghrelin intracellular signaling seem to be specific to brain region and, probably, also depend on the metabolic or stress status of the organism.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

DBS Think Tank presenters pooled data and determined that DBS expanded in its scope and has been applied to multiple brain disorders in an effort to modulate neural circuitry. The DBS Think Tank was founded in 2012 providing a space where clinicians, engineers, researchers from industry and academia discuss current and emerging DBS technologies and logistical and ethical issues facing the field. The emphasis is on cutting edge research and collaboration aimed to advance the DBS field. The Eighth Annual DBS Think Tank was held virtually on September 1 and 2, 2020 (Zoom Video Communications) due to restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The meeting focused on advances in: (1) optogenetics as a tool for comprehending neurobiology of diseases and on optogenetically-inspired DBS, (2) cutting edge of emerging DBS technologies, (3) ethical issues affecting DBS research and access to care, (4) neuromodulatory approaches for depression, (5) advancing novel hardware, software and imaging methodologies, (6) use of neurophysiological signals in adaptive neurostimulation, and (7) use of more advanced technologies to improve DBS clinical outcomes. There were 178 attendees who participated in a DBS Think Tank survey, which revealed the expansion of DBS into several indications such as obesity, post-traumatic stress disorder, addiction and Alzheimer's disease. This proceedings summarizes the advances discussed at the Eighth Annual DBS Think Tank.© Copyright © 2021 Vedam-Mai, Deisseroth, Giordano, Lazaro-Munoz, Chiong, Suthana, Langevin, Gill, Goodman, Provenza, Halpern, Shivacharan, Cunningham, Sheth, Pouratian, Scangos, Mayberg, Horn, Johnson, Butson, Gilron, de Hemptinne, Wilt, Yaroshinsky, Little, Starr, Worrell, Shirvalkar, Chang, Volkmann, Muthuraman, Groppa, Kuhn, Li, Johnson, Otto, Raike, Goetz, Wu, Silburn, Cheeran, Pathak, Malekmohammadi, Gunduz, Wong, Cernera, Wagle Shukla, Ramirez-Zamora, Deeb, Patterson, Foote and Okun.",Frontiers in Human Neuroscience,19-Apr-21

Previous studies suggested that higher levels of reward sensitivity were associated with problematic smartphone use. Therefore, the current study investigated the neural processing of monetary and social reward and punishment feedbacks between high and low problematic smartphone use adolescents. Method(s): 46 adolescents participated in the current study and they were categorized into two groups based on their level of problematic smartphone use: those who obtained low scores on the measure of problematic smartphone use were categorized as Low Problematic Smartphone Use (LPSU), and those who obtained high scores on the measure of problematic smartphone use were categorized as High Problematic Smartphone Use (HPSU). Electrocortical activities were recorded during the processing of monetary and social reward and punishment feedback. Result(s): (1) LPSUs evoked larger P3 in the social punishment condition than in the monetary punishment condition. HPSUs evoked larger P3 in the social reward condition than in the monetary condition. (2) The feedback-related negativity (FRN) amplitudes in the reward condition were significantly larger than those in the punishment condition. (3) HPSUs induced larger reward positivity in social feedback conditions than in monetary feedback conditions, while there were no significant differences between the two types of conditions in the LPSUs. Discussion(s): The results provide neural underpinning evidence that high sensitivity to social rewards may be related to problematic smartphone use in adolescence.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

Dysfunction in dopaminergic transmission is recognized as a core alteration in several devastating neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD), schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and addiction. Here we will discuss the current insights on the role of DA in motor control and reward learning mechanisms and its involvement in the modulation of synaptic dynamics through different pathways. In particular, we will consider the role of DA as neuromodulator of two forms of synaptic plasticity, known as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) in several cortical and subcortical areas. Finally, we will delineate how the effect of DA on dendritic spines places this molecule at the interface between the motor and the cognitive systems. Specifically, we will be focusing on PD, vascular dementia, and schizophrenia.Copyright © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Cells,Apr-21

Over the past decade, application of these tools in preclinical models of psychiatric disease has advanced our understanding the neural circuit basis of maladaptive behaviors in these disorders. Despite their power as an investigational tool, optogenetics cannot yet be applied in the clinical for the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders. To date, deep brain stimulation (DBS) is the only clinical treatment that can be used to achieve circuit-specific neuromodulation in the context of psychiatric. Despite its increasing clinical indications, the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of DBS for psychiatric disorders are poorly understood, which makes optimization difficult. We discuss the variety of optogenetic tools available for preclinical research, and how these tools have been leveraged to reverse-engineer the mechanisms underlying DBS for movement and compulsive disorders. We review studies that have used optogenetics to induce plasticity within defined basal ganglia circuits, to alter neural circuit function and evaluate the corresponding effects on motor and compulsive behaviors. While not immediately applicable to patient populations, the translational power of optogenetics is in inspiring novel DBS protocols by providing a rationale for targeting defined neural circuits to ameliorate specific behavioral symptoms, and by establishing optimal stimulation paradigms that could selectively compensate for pathological synaptic plasticity within these defined neural circuits.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",,Jan-21

However, behavioral sensitization (to recurrent stressors and psychomotor stimulants) and kindling of seizures both provide clues to mechanisms in the progressive course of bipolar disorder. Method(s): We describe aspects of bipolar illness that show sensitization and kindling-like increases reactivity to the recurrence of stressors, mood episodes, and bouts of substance abuse. Mechanisms of these events and clinical implications for treatment are discussed. Result(s): Early life stress is a risk factor for the development of episodes of unipolar depression and bipolar disorder and the acquisition of substance abuse. Initial affective episodes are often triggered by the recurrence of psychosocial stressors in adulthood, but after many episodes have occurred, episodes may also begin to emerge spontaneously in a kindling-like progression. More prior episodes are associated with faster recurrences, dysfunction, disability, frontal cortical abnormalities, cognitive impairment, shorter telomeres, treatment refractoriness, and an increased risk of a diagnosis of dementia in old age. Sensitization to stressors, episodes, and substances of abuse each appear driven by epigenetic mechanisms and their accumulation on DNA, histones, and microRNA. Patients with bipolar illness in the USA are more ill than those from Europe and experience more sensitization to stressors, episodes, substance abuse, as well as more genetic vulnerability across four generations. Discussion(s): The sensitization and kindling models highlight the importance of early intervention and prevention in order to limit or halt the downhill progression of bipolar disorder and its multiple comorbidities toward treatment refractoriness. Clinical data support this conclusion as well but have not been sufficient to change practice in the direction of early intervention. It is hoped that a better understanding of sensitization and kindling-like mechanisms will add neurobiological rationales for the importance of prevention and sustained prophylactic intervention in rendering bipolar disorder a more benign illness.Copyright © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,2021

substance use","Females are more vulnerable than males to many aspects of cocaine use disorder. This vulnerability also translates to opioid use disorder, with females exhibiting stronger behavioral responses than males to drugs such as heroin and morphine. While there is evidence for many overlapping neural mechanisms underlying cocaine and opioid abuse, there is also a breadth of evidence indicating divergent effects of the drugs on synaptic plasticity. This makes it unclear whether the behavioral sex differences seen in substance use disorder across different drugs of abuse rely on the same mechanisms. Ovarian hormones have consistently been implicated as drivers of the behavioral sex differences in cocaine taking and seeking. While there are far fewer studies on the role of ovarian hormones in opioid use disorder, the existing data suggest that ovarian hormones may not drive these behavioral effects in the same manner as in cocaine use disorder. This review highlights evidence that behavioral sex differences in substance use disorder might be driven by different mechanisms depending on drug class.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews,Sep-21

volumetry","ADHD is a disorder characterized by changes in the reward system and which is highly comorbid with other mental disorders, suggesting common neurobiological pathways. Transdiagnostic neuroimaging findings could help to understand whether a dysregulated reward pathway might be the actual link between ADHD and its comorbidities. We here synthesize ADHD neuroimaging findings on the reward system with findings in obesity, depression, and substance use disorder including their comorbid appearance regarding neuroanatomical features (structural MRI) and activation patterns (resting-state and functional MRI). We focus on findings from monetary-incentive-delay (MID) and delay-discounting (DD) tasks and then review data on striatal connectivity and volumetry. Next, for better understanding of comorbidity in adult ADHD, we discuss these neuroimaging features in ADHD, obesity, depression and substance use disorder and ask whether ADHD heterogeneity and comorbidity are reflected by a common dysregulation in the reward system. Finally, we highlight conceptual issues related to heterogeneous paradigms, different phenotyping, longitudinal prediction and highlight some promising future directions for using striatal reward functioning as a clinical biomarker.Copyright © 2021",Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews,Sep-21

Review","Introduction: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has achieved substantial success as a treatment for movement disorders such as Parkinson's Disease (PD), essential tremor (ET), and dystonia. More recently, a limited number of basic and clinical studies have indicated that DBS of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and other neighbouring structures of the reward circuit may be an effective intervention for patients with treatment-refractory addiction. Material(s) and Method(s): We performed a structured literature review of human studies of DBS for addiction outlining the clinical efficacy and adverse events. We found 14 human studies targeting mostly the NAc with neighbouring structures such as anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC). Five studies including 12 patients reported the outcomes for alcohol dependence. Nine studies including 18patientsreportedtheoutcomesforaddictionstovariouspsychoactivesubstances.Themostcommonindicationwasaddictiontohe-roin,foundin13patients,followedbymethamphetamine,3patients,cocaine,onepatient,andpolysubstancedrugabuseinonepatient. Conclusion(s): The limited clinical data available indicates that DBS may be a promising therapeutic modality for the treatment of intractable addiction. In general, the safety profile of DBS in patients with addiction is good. Based on the data published in the literature, the NAc is the most often targeted, and is probably the most effective, structure of the reward circuit in the treatment of addiction in humans. Given the ever-expanding understanding of the psychosurgery of addiction, DBS could in the future be a treatment option for patients suffering from intractable addictive disorders.Copyright © 2021 Polish Neurological Society",Neurologia i Neurochirurgia Polska,29-Oct-21

withdrawal syndrome","Drug addiction is responsible for millions of deaths per year around the world. Still, its management as a chronic disease is shadowed by misconceptions from the general public. Indeed, drug consumers are often labelled as ""weak"", ""immoral"" or ""depraved"". Consequently, drug addiction is often perceived as an individual problem and not societal. In technical terms, drug addiction is defined as a chronic, relapsing disease resulting from sustained effects of drugs on the brain. Through a better characterisation of the cerebral circuits involved, and the long-term modifications of the brain induced by addictive drugs administrations, first, we might be able to change the way the general public see the patient who is suffering from drug addiction, and second, we might be able to find new treatments to normalise the altered brain homeostasis. In this review, we synthetise the contribution of fundamental research to the understanding drug addiction and its contribution to potential novel therapeutics. Mostly based on drug-induced modifications of synaptic plasticity and epigenetic mechanisms (and their behavioural correlates) and after demonstration of their reversibility, we tried to highlight promising therapeutics. We also underline the specific temporal dynamics and psychosocial aspects of this complex psychiatric disease adding parameters to be considered in clinical trials and paving the way to test new therapeutic venues.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).",Translational Psychiatry,Dec-21

treatment outcome","The habenula is a small bilateral epithalamic structure that plays a key role in the regulation of the main monoaminergic systems. It is implicated in many aspects of behavior such as reward processing, motivational behavior, behavioral adaptation, and sensory integration. A role of the habenula has been indicated in the pathophysiology of a number of neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression, addiction, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and bipolar disorder. Neuromodulation of the habenula using deep brain stimulation (DBS) as potential treatment has been proposed and a first successful case of habenula DBS was reported a decade ago. To provide an overview of the current state of habenula DBS in human subjects for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders we conducted a systematic review of both the published literature using PUBMED and current and past registered clinical trials using ClinicalTrials.gov as well as the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. Using PRISMA guidelines five articles and five registered clinical trials were identified. The published articles detailed the results of habenula DBS for the treatment of schizophrenia, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and bipolar disorder. Four are single case studies; one reports findings in two patients and positive clinical outcome is described in five of the six patients. Of the five registered clinical trials identified, four investigate habenula DBS for the treatment of depression and one for obsessive-compulsive disorder. One trial is listed as terminated, one is recruiting, two are not yet recruiting and the status of the fifth is unknown. The planned enrollment varies between 2 to 13 subjects and four of the five are open label trials. While the published studies suggest a potential role of habenula DBS for a number of indications, future trials and studies are necessary. The outcomes of the ongoing clinical trials will provide further valuable insights. Establishing habenula DBS, however, will depend on successful randomized clinical trials to confirm application and clinical benefit of this promising intervention.© Copyright © 2021 Germann, Mameli, Elias, Loh, Taha, Gouveia, Boutet and Lozano.",Frontiers in Psychiatry,17-Aug-21

However, given the current opioid epidemic, non-pharmacological interventions that reduce pain, such as spinal cord stimulation (SCS), are needed. The purpose of this study was to review the evidence on paresthesia-free 10 kHz SCS therapy for neck and upper extremity pain. Method(s): Systematic literature search was performed for studies reporting outcomes for cervical 10 kHz SCS using date limits from May 2008 to November 2020. The study results were analyzed and described qualitatively. Additionally, when feasible, meta-analyses of the outcome data, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), were conducted using both the fixed-effects (FE) and random-effects (RE) models. Result(s): A total of 15 studies were eligible for inclusion. The proportion of patients who achieved >= 50% pain reduction was 83% (95% CI 77-89%) in both the FE and RE models. The proportion of patients who reduced/eliminated their opioid consumption was 39% (95% CI 31-46%) in the FE model and 39% (95% CI 31-48%) in the RE model. Pain or discomfort with the implant, lead migration, and infections were potential risks following cervical SCS. Explant rate was 0.1 (95% CI 0.0-0.2) events per 100 person-months, and no patients in the included studies experienced a neurological complication or paresthesia. Conclusion(s): Findings suggest 10 kHz SCS is a promising, safe, minimally invasive alternative for managing chronic upper limb and neck pain.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).",Pain and Therapy,Dec-21

World Health Organization","Background: TikTok is a social media platform where users create and share videos. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of this site greatly expanded. Tic and Tourette syndrome content also increased dramatically along with the number of patients with tics in neurology clinics. Objective(s): We compared the phenomenology of ""TikTok tics"" to typical tic disorders. We chose to analyze the most widely viewed videos and therefore focused on the most popular content creators. Method(s): Videos with the keywords ""tic,"" ""Tourette,"" or ""tourettes"" were reviewed to identify content creators between March 11, 2020 and March 30, 2021. We performed a quantitative assessment of TikTok tics as well as a descriptive analysis of the entire series of videos of each content creator. Result(s): The mean age of the cohort was 18.8 years old, and the majority were women. Unlike the predominance of facial movements in typical tics, arm movements were most frequent. Average tics per minute was 29, and almost all recorded TikTok tics were severe, causing significant disability. Whereas coprolalia and self-injurious behavior are only infrequently encountered in typical tic disorders, they were present in the overwhelming majority of TikTok subjects. Conclusion(s): TikTok tics are distinct from what is typically seen in patients with Tourette syndrome, although share many characteristics with functional tics. We believe this to be an example of mass sociogenic illness, which involves behaviors, emotions, or conditions spreading spontaneously through a group. A modern clinician needs to remain abreast of social media sources as knowledge of media content is essential in managing patients in the current environment.Copyright © 2021 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society",Movement Disorders Clinical Practice,Nov-21

This study aims to evaluate the effect of bilateral transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) over the right/left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on the cognitive abilities of OUD men. Method(s): This study is a double-blind sham-controlled randomized clinical trial with a pretest/posttest design. Participants were 31 men with OUD living in Zanjan, Iran, assigned to three groups of left anode/right cathode tDCS, right anode/left cathode tDCS, and sham tDCS. The two active groups received tDCS (2 mA) at 10 sessions each for 10-20 min. The Cognitive Abilities Questionnaire (CAQ) in Persian was used to measure their cognitive abilities before and after intervention. Collected data were analyzed in SPSS v.22 software. Result(s): Bilateral DLPFC stimulation resulted in a significant improvement in cognitive flexibility, planning, decision making, inhibitory control/selective attention, and memory of patients in the two active tDCS groups, while the sham tDCS had no significant effect on their cognitive abilities. Conclusion(s): Bilateral tDCS over DLPFC, as an effective and complementary treatment, can improve the cognitive abilities of men with OUD. Trial registration: This study is a double-blind sham-controlled clinical trial (Parallel, IRCT20170513033946N5.

*withdrawal syndrome","The epithalamic lateral habenula (LHb) regulates monoaminergic systems and contributes to the expression of both appetitive and aversive behaviours. Over the past years, the LHb has emerged as a vulnerable brain structure in mental illnesses including addiction. Behavioural and functional evidence in humans and rodents provide substantial support for a role of LHb in the negative affective symptoms emerging during withdrawal from addictive substances. Multiple forms of cellular and synaptic adaptations that take hold during drug withdrawal within the LHb are causally linked with the emergence of negative affective symptoms. These results indicate that targeting drug withdrawal-driven adaptations in the LHb may represent a potential strategy to normalize drug-related behavioural adaptations. In the current review we describe the mechanisms leading to functional alterations in the LHb, as well as the existing interventions used to counteract addictive behaviours. Finally, closing this loop we discuss and propose new avenues to potentially target the LHb in humans in light of the mechanistic understanding stemming from pre-clinical studies. Altogether, we provide an overview on how to leverage cellular-level understanding to envision clinically-relevant approaches for the treatment of specific aspects in drug addiction.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s)",Neuropharmacology,01-Jul-21

Optogenetic or neurochemical stimulation of CeA circuitry can generate intense incentive motivation to pursue and consume a paired natural food, sex, or addictive drug reward, and even create maladaptive 'wanting what hurts' such as attraction to a shock rod. Evidence indicates CeA stimulations selectively amplify incentive motivation ('wanting') but not hedonic impact ('liking') of the same reward. Further, valence flips can occur for CeA contributions to motivational salience. That is, CeA stimulation can promote either incentive motivation or fearful motivation, even in the same individual, depending on situation. These findings may carry implications for understanding CeA roles in neuropsychiatric disorders involving aberrant motivational salience, ranging from addiction to paranoia and anxiety disorders.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Behavioural Brain Research,06-Aug-21

subthalamic nucleus","In Parkinson's disease, both motor and neuropsychiatric complications unfold as a consequence of both incremental striatal dopaminergic denervation and intensifying long-term dopaminergic treatment. Together, this leads to 'dopaminergic sensitization' steadily increasing motor and behavioral responses to dopaminergic medication that result in the detrimental sequalae of long-term dopaminergic treatment. We review the clinical presentations of 'dopaminergic sensitization', including rebound off and dyskinesia in the motor domain, and neuropsychiatric fluctuations and behavioral addictions with impulse control disorders and dopamine dysregulation syndrome in the neuropsychiatric domain. We summarize state-of-the-art deep brain stimulation, and show that STN-DBS allows dopaminergic medication to be tapered, thus supporting dopaminergic desensitization. In this framework, we develop our integrated debatable viewpoint of ""changing gears"", that is we suggest rethinking earlier use of subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation, when the first clinical signs of dopaminergic motor or neuropsychiatric complications emerge over the steadily progressive disease course. In this sense, subthalamic deep brain stimulation may help reduce longitudinal motor and neuropsychiatric symptom expression - importantly, not by neuroprotection but by supporting dopaminergic desensitization through postoperative medication reduction. Therefore, we suggest considering STN-DBS early enough before patients encounter potentially irreversible psychosocial consequences of dopaminergic complications, but importantly not before a patient shows first clinical signs of dopaminergic complications. We propose to consider neuropsychiatric dopaminergic complications as a new inclusion criterion in addition to established motor criteria, but this concept will require validation in future clinical trials.

twiddler syndrome","Background: Rechargeable implantable pulse generator (IPG) technology has several advantages over non-rechargeable systems and is routinely used now in deep brain stimulation (DBS). Little is known about the occasional need and the circumstances for switching back to non-rechargeable technology. Cases: Out of a cohort of 640 patients, 102 patients received a rechargeable IPG at first implantation or at the time of replacement surgery. Out of these, 3 patients underwent preemptive replacement with non-rechargeable devices for the following reasons: dissatisfaction with handling and recharge frequency (pallidal DBS in advanced Parkinson's disease/dystonia), severe DBS OFF status subsequent to missed recharging (subthalamic DBS in Parkinson's disease) and twiddler's syndrome (nucleus accumbens DBS in alcohol dependency). Conclusion(s): Although rechargeable IPG technology has been received well and is used widely, there are unexpected scenarios that require replacement surgery with non-rechargeable IPGs.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

transcranial magnetic stimulation","Introduction: Alcohol use disorder (AUD) ranks among the leading causes of decrements in disability-adjusted life-years. Long-term exposure to alcohol leads to an imbalance of activity between frontal cortical systems and the striatum, thereby enhancing impulsive behaviours and weakening inhibitory control. Alternative therapeutic approaches such as non-invasive and invasive brain stimulation have gained some momentum in the field of addictology by capitalizing on their ability to target specific anatomical structures and correct abnormalities in dysfunctional brain circuits. Material(s) and Method(s): The current review, covers original peer-reviewed published research on the use of brain stimulation methods for the rehabilitation of AUD. A broad and systematic search was carried out on four electronic databases: NCBI PubMed, Web of Science, Handbooks and the Cochrane Library. Any original article in English or French language, without restrictions of patient age or gender, article type and publication outlet, were included in the final pool of selected studies. Result(s): The outcomes of this systematic review suggest that the dorsolateral prefrontral cortex (DLPFC) is a promising target for treating AUD with high frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. Such effect would reduce feelings of craving by enhancing cognitive control and modulating striatal function. Existing literature also supports the notion that changes of DLPFC activity driven by transcranial direct current stimulation, could decrease alcohol craving and consumption. However, to date, no major differences have been found between the efficacy of these two non-invasive brain-stimulation approaches, which require further confirmation. In contrast, beneficial stronger evidence supports an impact of deep brain stimulation reducing craving and improving quality of life in AUD, effects that would be mediated by an impact on the nucleus accumbens, a central structure of the brain's reward circuitry. Overall, neurostimulation shows promise contributing to the treatment of AUD. Nonetheless, progress has been limited by a number of factors such as the low number of controlled randomized trials, small sample sizes, variety of stimulation parameters precluding comparability and incomplete or questionable sham-conditions. Additionally, a lack of data concerning clinical impact on the severity of AUD or craving and the short follow up periods precluding and accurate estimation of effect duration after discontinuing the treatment, has also limited the clinical relevance of final outcomes. Conclusion(s): Brain stimulation remains a promising approach to contribute to AUD therapy, co-adjuvant of more conventional procedures. However, a stronger therapeutic rational based on solid physio-pathological evidence and accurate estimates of efficacy, are still required to achieve further therapeutic success and expand clinical use.Copyright © 2021 The Authors",Comprehensive Psychiatry,Aug-21

vagus nerve stimulation","The World Health Organization reported a lifetime prevalence of 2.4% for BD-I, BD-II and sub-threshold types of bipolar disorder (BD). Depressive episodes are more common than manic episodes for many BD patients. Studies show that depressive mood persists in 2/3 of life, even if they are under treatment. It may be difficult to diagnose BD in the event of depression in the first episode. The correct diagnosis and the treatment can be delayed for 6-8 years, and even longer if disorder starts in adolescence. It is reported that 40% of the patients who were initially diagnosed as unipolar were later diagnosed as BD. The features that enable us to diagnose BD depressive episode: 1) family history of BD or psychosis 2) early onset with depression 3) cyclothymic temperament characteristics 4) four or more depressive episodes in 10 years 5) agitation, anger, insomnia, irritability, excessive talkativeness or other 'mixed' or hypomanic features or psychotic symptoms during depressive episode, 6) clinical 'worsening' caused by the appearance of mixed symptoms after AD treatment 7) suicidal thoughts and attempts 8) substance abuse 9) hypersomnia in the depressive episode or sleeping too much during the day, overeating, psychomotor agitation. The number of studies conducted on BD depressive treatment is limited, the information was obtained by excluding this group from the studies or by compiling the information obtained from the treatment of unipolar depression. In this review, acute and maintenance treatment of the depressive episodes of BD will be discussed according to the treatment algorithms.Copyright © 2021 by Turkish Association of Neuropsychiatry-Available online at www.noropskiyatriarsivi.com.",Noropsikiyatri Arsivi,Oct-21

transcranial direct current stimulation","Background: Most psychiatric disorders have their onset in childhood or adolescence, and if not fully treated have the potential for causing life-long psycho-social and physical sequelae. Effective psychotherapeutic and medication treatments exist, but a significant proportion of children and young people do not make a full recovery. Thus, novel, safe, brain-based alternatives or adjuncts to conventional treatments are needed. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) are non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques which have shown clinical benefits in adult psychiatric conditions. However, in children and young people their efficacy is not well established. The objective of this study will be to systematically evaluate the evidence on clinical effects of NIBS in children and young people with psychiatric disorders, assessing disorder-specific symptoms, mood and neurocognitive functions. Method(s): We designed and registered a study protocol for a systematic review. We will include randomised and non-randomised controlled trials and observational studies (e.g. cohort, case-control, case series) assessing the effects of NIBS in children and young people (aged <= 24 years old) for psychiatric disorders. The primary outcome will be reduction of disorder-specific symptoms. Secondary outcomes will include effects on mood and cognition. A comprehensive search from database inception onwards will be conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO. Grey literature will be identified through searching multiple clinical trial registries. Two reviewers will independently screen all citations, full-text articles and abstract data. The methodological quality of the studies will be appraised using appropriate tools. We will provide a narrative synthesis of the evidence and according to heterogeneity will conduct an appropriate meta-analysis. Additional analyses will be conducted to explore the potential sources of heterogeneity. Discussion(s): This systematic review will provide a broad and comprehensive evaluation of the evidence on clinical effects of NIBS in children and young people with psychiatric disorders. Our findings will be reported according to the PRISMA guidelines and will be of interest to multiple audiences (including patients, researchers, healthcare professionals and policy-makers). Results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. Systematic review registration: PROSPERO CRD42019158957.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).",Systematic Reviews,Dec-21

Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale","We investigated whether the personality of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) before subthalamic brain stimulation differed from patients receiving drug treatments and whether the personality of patients affected surgical decisions. We recruited 38 patients with advanced PD scheduled for deep brain stimulation (DBS), 40 patients with PD receiving the very best medical treatment, and 51 healthy control subjects. All participants were evaluated by the Minnesota multiphasic personality inventory-1 (MMPI-1). PD patients who were candidates for DBS did not exhibit any significant differences in personality when compared with PD patients who were treated with drugs. Compared with healthy controls, patients with PD had remarkably higher MMPI-1 scores for spiritual quality, neuroticism, and introversion, but significantly lower scores for socialization. In addition, patients with PD were more submissive, more dependent on others, and less active in social activities. Our data indicated that the main deciding factor relating to whether to undergo DBS was the disease itself and not the pathological personality. However, neurotic and psychotic symptoms accompanying PD may influence the effect of DBS. We found that greater benefit is obtained by surgical or medical interventions if abnormal neurotic characteristics are considered early in the course of PD.Copyright © 2021 Wei Lin et al.",Behavioural Neurology,2021

young adult","Maladaptive cortical plasticity has been described in individuals with heroin and methamphetamine addiction and may mediate other substance abuse disorders. It is unknown whether cannabis dependence in humans alters the capacity for induction of cortical plasticity. The aim of this study was to non-invasively investigate cortical plasticity with transcranial magnetic stimulation in young adults who meet DSM-5 criteria for cannabis use disorder (CUD). Thirty men (ages 20- 30) who used cannabis daily over the previous 6 months (15 diagnosed of CUD) and 15 demographically matched non-users were enrolled in this study. All participants underwent two sessions of theta burst stimulation (TBS) in which either continuous TBS (cTBS; 600 pulses, 80% active motor threshold) or intermittent TBS (iTBS; 2-s train of cTBS repeated every 10 s for a total of 190 s, 600 pulses) was applied over the primary motor cortex. The effects of these protocols were assessed by analysing the contralateral motor evoked potentials (MEPs). The relationships between cortical plasticity and problematic cannabis use, degree of dependence, and nicotine addiction were also investigated. Significant MEP inhibition after cTBS was observed in both cannabis users without CUD and non-users, while this inhibition was not seen in cannabis users with CUD. Strikingly, less motor cortical plasticity was observed in subjects with severe problematic cannabis use. No significant differences between users and non-users were found in the iTBS-induced cortical plasticity measures. Our study provides the first evidence of maladaptive cortical plasticity associated with cannabis use disorder and problematic cannabis use in humans.Copyright © 2020 Society for the Study of Addiction",Addiction Biology,May-21

The three channels co-express in various brain regions, and their collective action strongly influences cellular excitability. However, significant diversity exists in the expression of channel isoforms in distinct brain regions and various subcellular compartments, which contributes to an equally diverse set of specific neuronal functions. The current review emphasizes the collective behavior of the three classes of mAHP channels and discusses how these channels function together although they play specialized roles. We discuss the biophysical properties of these channels, signaling pathways that influence the activity of the three mAHP channels, various chemical modulators that alter channel activity and their therapeutic potential in treating various neurological anomalies. Additionally, we discuss the role of mAHP channels in the pathophysiology of various neurological diseases and how their modulation can alleviate some of the symptoms.© Copyright © 2021 Dwivedi and Bhalla.",Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience,03-Jun-21

Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale","The obsessive-compulsive spectrum refers to disorders drawn from several diagnostic categories that share core features related to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), such as obsessive thoughts, compulsive behaviors and anxiety. Disorders that include these features can be grouped according to the focus of the symptoms, e.g., bodily preoccupation (i.e., eating disorders, ED) or impulse control (i.e., substance use disorders, SUD), and they exhibit intriguing similarities in phenomenology, etiology, pathophysiology, patient characteristics and clinical outcomes. The non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAr) antagonist ketamine has been indicated to produce remarkable results in patients with treatment-resistant depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and OCD in dozens of small studies accrued over the past decade, and it appears to be promising in the treatment of SUD and ED. However, despite many small studies, solid evidence for the benefits of its use in the treatment of OCD spectrum and addiction is still lacking. Thus, the aim of this perspective article is to examine the potential for ketamine and esketamine in treating OCD, ED and SUD, which all involve recurring and intrusive thoughts and generate associated compulsive behavior. A comprehensive and updated overview of the literature regarding the pharmacological mechanisms of action of both ketamine and esketamine, as well as their therapeutic advantages over current treatments, are provided in this paper. An electronic search was performed, including all papers published up to April 2021, using the following keywords (""ketamine"" or ""esketamine"") AND (""obsessive"" OR ""compulsive"" OR ""OCD"" OR ""SUD"" OR ""substance use disorder"" OR ""addiction"" OR ""craving"" OR ""eating"" OR ""anorexia"") NOT review NOT animal NOT ""in vitro"", on the PubMed, Cochrane Library and Web of Science online databases. The review was conducted in accordance with preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The use and efficacy of ketamine in SUD, ED and OCD is supported by glutamatergic neurotransmission dysregulation, which plays an important role in these conditions. Ketamine's use is increasing, and preliminary data are optimistic. Further studies are needed in order to better clarify the many unknowns related to the use of both ketamine and esketamine in SUD, ED and OCD, and to understand their long-term effectiveness.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

IGD is an area of concern in the Diagnostic and Statistics Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), which can be objectively assessed by dysfunctional behaviour and the increasing time of being online, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Electroencephalography (EEG) identifies amplitude changes in the evoked response potential (ERP) among IGDs, correlated with underlying comorbidities. Material(s) and Method(s): A scoping review was performed to elaborate on the research regarding resting-state EEG and task-based EEG, particularly for Go/No-go paradigms pertaining to subjects with IAD or specifically IGD. The role of EEG was identified in its diagnostic capability to identify the salient changes that occurred in the response to reward network and the executive control network, using resting-state and task-based EEG. The implication of using EEG in monitoring the therapy for IAD and IGD was also reviewed. Result(s): EEG generally revealed reduced beta waves and increased theta waves in addicts. IGD with depression demonstrated increased theta and decreased alpha waves. Whereas increased P300, a late cognitive ERP component, was frequently associated with impaired excessive allocation of attentional resources of the IAD towards addiction-specific cues. IGD had increased whole brain delta waves at baseline, which showed significant reduction post therapy. Conclusion(s): EEG can identify distinct neurophysiological changes among Internet Addiction Disorder and Internet Gaming Disorder that are akin to substance abuse disorders.Copyright © 2021, Malaysian Medical Association.

Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale

Young Mania Rating Scale","Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), a leading cause of disability, affects ~1-2% of the population, and can be distressing and disabling. About 1/3 of individuals demonstrate poor responsiveness to conventional treatments. A small proportion of these individuals may be deep brain stimulation (DBS) candidates. Candidacy is assessed through a multidisciplinary process including assessment of illness severity, chronicity, and functional impact. Optimization failure, despite multiple treatments, is critical during screening. Few patients nationwide are eligible for OCD DBS and thus a multi-center approach was necessary to obtain adequate sample size. The study was conducted over a six-year period and was a NIH-funded, eight-center sham-controlled trial of DBS targeting the ventral capsule/ventral striatum (VC/VS) region. There were 269 individuals who initially contacted the sites, in order to achieve 27 participants enrolled. Study enrollment required extensive review for eligibility, which was overseen by an independent advisory board. Disabling OCD had to be persistent for >=5 years despite exhaustive medication and behavioral treatment. The final cohort was derived from a detailed consent process that included consent monitoring. Mean illness duration was 27.2 years. OCD symptom subtypes and psychiatric comorbidities varied, but all had severe disability with impaired quality of life and functioning. Participants were randomized to receive sham or active DBS for three months. Following this period, all participants received active DBS. Treatment assignment was masked to participants and raters and assessments were blinded. The final sample was consistent in demographic characteristics and clinical features when compared to other contemporary published prospective studies of OCD DBS. We report the clinical trial design, methods, and general demographics of this OCD DBS sample.Copyright © 2021 The Authors",Contemporary Clinical Trials Communications,Jun-21

In this study, we applied the revised Cochrane risk of bias tool (ROB 2) to RCTs of drug, alcohol or tobacco interventions. Method(s): We searched for trials published in 15 addiction medicine journals over a 7-year period. Our primary endpoint is the risk of bias of included studies. We conducted a sensitivity analysis of publicly funded trials. Result(s): Overall, included RCTs were most often at high risk of bias per our judgments (244/487, 50.1%). However, significant proportions of included RCTs were at low risk of bias (123/487, 25.3%) or some concerns for bias (120/497, 24.6%). RCTs with behavioral modification interventions (19/44, 43.2%) and alcohol interventions (80/150, 53.3%) had the highest proportion of high-risk judgments. In a sensitivity analysis of publicly funded RCTs), 195/386 (50.5%) were at high risk of bias. Conclusion(s): Approximately half of included drug, alcohol or tobacco RCTs in our sample were judged to be at high risk of bias with the most common reason being a lack of proper blinding or proper description of blinding. Key action items to reduce bias in future addiction RCTs include adequate randomization, blinding and inclusion of a trial registry number and protocol.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

working memory","Tobacco is a one of the most common addictive stimulants used by people around the world. The smoke generated during tobacco combustion is a toxic mixture of more than 5000 chemicals of which over 30 are known human carcinogens. While its negative effects on the human body are well understood, it remains a serious public health problem. One of the multiple effects of smoking is tobacco's effect on the nervous system-its development and function. This review aims to summarize the progress made in research on the effects of tobacco on the nervous system both of the perinatal period and adults and both in animals and humans in 2015-2020. The 1245 results that corresponded to the keywords ""tobacco, cigarette, nervous system, brain, morphology, function"" were reviewed, of which 200 abstracts were considered significant. Most of those articles broadened the knowledge about the negative effects of smoking on the human nervous system. Tobacco has a significant negative impact on the development of nervous structures, neurotransmission and cognitive functions, and promotes the development of neurodegenerative diseases, insomnia and cerebrovascular diseases. The only exception is the protective effect of the dopaminergic system in Parkinson's disease. In conclusion, in recent years much effort has been devoted to describing, revealing and uncovering new aspects of tobacco detrimental to human life. The nicotine contained in tobacco smoke affects the human body in a multidimensional way, including a serious impact on the broadly understood neurological health.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) may have a beneficial reduction in the addiction-reward pathway. Recent studies have found reduced relapse and improvements in quality of life following DBS stimulation of the nucleus accumbens. We aim to identify positive outcomes and adverse effects to assess the viability of DBS as a treatment of addiction. A PubMed search following PRISMA guidelines was conducted to identify the entirety of reports reporting DBS as a treatment for SUD. Outcomes were extracted from the literature to be summarized, and a review of the quality of publications was also performed. From 2305 publications, 14 studies were found to fit the inclusion criteria published between 2007 and 2019. All studies targeted the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and remission rates at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and more than 6 years were 61% (20/33), 53% (17/32), 43% (14/30), and 50% (3/6), respectively. Not all studies detailed the stimulation settings or coordinates. The most common adverse effect across studies was a weight change of at least 2 kg. DBS shows potential as a long-term treatment of SUD in refractory patients. Further studies with controlled double-blind paradigms are needed for evaluation of the efficacy and safety of this treatment. Future studies should also investigate other brain regions for stimulation and optimal device stimulation parameters.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Neurosurgical Review,Aug-21

schizophrenia","Executive functions, or cognitive control, are higher-order cognitive functions needed for adaptive goal-directed behaviours and are significantly impaired in majority of neuropsychiatric disorders. Different models and approaches are proposed for describing how executive functions are functionally organised in the brain. One popular and recently proposed organising principle of executive functions is the distinction between hot (i.e. reward or affective-related) versus cold (i.e. purely cognitive) domains of executive functions. The prefrontal cortex is traditionally linked to executive functions, but on the other hand, anterior and posterior cingulate cortices are hugely involved in executive functions as well. In this review, we first define executive functions, their domains, and the appropriate methods for studying them. Second, we discuss how hot and cold executive functions are linked to different areas of the prefrontal cortex. Next, we discuss the association of hot versus cold executive functions with the cingulate cortex, focusing on the anterior and posterior compartments. Finally, we propose a functional model for hot and cold executive function organisation in the brain with a specific focus on the fronto-cingular network. We also discuss clinical implications of hot versus cold cognition in major neuropsychiatric disorders (depression, schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, substance use disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and autism) and attempt to characterise their profile according to the functional dominance or manifest of hot-cold cognition. Our model proposes that the lateral prefrontal cortex along with the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex are more relevant for cold executive functions, while the medial-orbital prefrontal cortex along with the ventral anterior cingulate cortex, and the posterior cingulate cortex are more closely involved in hot executive functions. This functional distinction, however, is not absolute and depends on several factors including task features, context, and the extent to which the measured function relies on cognition and emotion or both.Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.",Brain and Neuroscience Advances,2021

systematic review

transcranial direct current stimulation","Introduction: A significant proportion of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) display a set of impulsive-compulsive behaviors at some point during the course of illness. These behaviors range from the so-called behavioral addictions to dopamine dysregulation syndrome, punding and hoarding disorders. These behaviors have been consistently linked to the use of dopaminergic medications used to treat PD motor symptoms (dopamine agonists, levodopa, and other agents) and less consistently to neuromodulation techniques such as deep brain stimulation (DBS). Since there are still no approved treatments for these conditions, their pharmacological management is still a big challenge for clinicians. Method(s): We conducted an extensive review of current pharmacological and neuromodulation literature for the management of impulsive-compulsive disorders in PD patients. Result(s): Pharmacological treatment approaches for impulsive-compulsive behaviors and DDS in PD patients include reduction of levodopa (LD), reduction/cessation of dopamine agonist (DA), and initiation of infusion therapies (apomorphine infusion and duodopa). Also, atomoxetine, a noradrenergic agent approved for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, showed some interesting preliminary results but there is still a lack of controlled longitudinal studies. Finally, while DBS effects on impulsive-compulsive disorders are still controversial, non-invasive techniques (such as transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation) could have a potential positive effect but, again, there is still a lack of controlled trials. Conclusion(s): Managing impulsivity and compulsivity in PD patients is still a non-evidence-based challenge for clinicians. Controlled trials on promising approaches such as atomoxetine and non-invasive neuromodulation techniques are needed.Copyright © 2021, Fondazione Societa Italiana di Neurologia.",Neurological Sciences,Jul-21

Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale","Background: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has demonstrated preliminary success as a treatment for neuropsychological disorders including obsessive-compulsive disorder and substance use disorder. This systematic review aims to assess the use of DBS in treating eating disorders (EDs) to determine its utility and the extent of adverse effects. Method(s): A PubMed search following PRISMA guidelines was executed to find studies encompassing DBS as a treatment of ED. Outcomes were extracted from the literature and summarized while a review of quality was also performed. Result(s): From a search yielding 299 publications, 11 studies published between 2010 and 2020 were found to fit the inclusion criteria. Out of 53 patients who began with an abnormal BMI before treatment, 22 patients (41.5%) achieved normal BMI on follow-up. Significant neuropsychological improvement was seen in most patients as measured by neuropsychiatric testing and questionnaires. Conclusion(s): DBS as a treatment for ED may result in significant objective and psychological benefits. Further studies should aim to increase the sample size, standardize follow-up protocol, and standardize the neuropsychiatric tests used to determine psychological and physiological benefits.Copyright © 2021 Published by Scientific Scholar on behalf of Surgical Neurology International",Surgical Neurology International,19-Apr-21

DBS electrodes were implanted bilaterally within the Nucleus Accumbens/Ventral anterior internal capsule (NAc/VC) of a man in his early 30s with >10-year history of severe treatment refractory opioid and benzodiazepine use disorders. DBS of the NAc/VC was found to be safe with no serious adverse events noted and the participant remained abstinent and engaged in comprehensive treatment at the 12-week endpoint (and 12-month extended follow-up). Using a 0-100 visual analog scale, substance cravings decreased post-DBS implantation; most substantially in benzodiazepine craving following the final DBS titration (1.0 +/- 2.2) compared to baseline (53.4 +/- 29.5; p < .001). A trend toward improvement in frontal/executive function was observed on the balloon analog risk task performance following the final titration (217.7 +/- 76.2) compared to baseline (131.3 +/- 28.1, p = .066). FDG PET demonstrated an increase in glucose metabolism in the dorsolateral prefrontal and medial premotor cortices at the 12-week endpoint compared to post-surgery/pre-DBS titration. Heart Rate Variability (HRV) improved following the final titration (rMSSD = 56.0 +/- 11.7) compared to baseline (19.2 +/- 8.2; p < .001). In a participant with severe, treatment refractory opioid and benzodiazepine use disorder, DBS of the NAc/VC was safe, reduced substance use and craving, and improved frontal and executive functions. Confirmation of these findings with future studies is needed.

In an individual with severe, treatment refractory opioid and benzodiazepine use disorder, deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the Nucleus Accumbens/Ventral Capsule was found to be safe and this participant remained entirely abstinent from illicit substance use throughout the 12-month follow-up. These findings must be replicated so that more substantive conclusions regarding the utility of DBS for SUD can be made.

*schizophrenia","The serotonin 2B receptor (5-HT2BR) is the most recent addition to the 5-HT2R family. During the last decade, a growing number of studies have shown that the central 5-HT2BR participates in the control of serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) neuron activity and have underlined its potential for new therapeutic strategies for several neuropsychiatric disorders such as drug addiction, depression and schizophrenia. After reviewing the major advances in the identification and characterization of this receptor within the central nervous system, this chapter focuses on its functional role in the control of ascending DA pathway activity and on the mechanisms underlying this interaction, by covering electrophysiological, neurochemical and behavioral data mainly from in vivo studies in rats. Afterwards, the therapeutic relevance of 5-HT2BR antagonists for treating DA-dependent neuropsychiatric disorders is discussed by focusing on schizophrenia.Copyright © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,2021

zebra fish","Monoamines, particularly serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT), have been extensively studied in the context of aggression. 5-HT is known to play a key role in the modulation of aggressive, impulsive, antisocial, and violent behavior. There are several hypotheses that intend to explain the underlying relationship between 5-HT and aggressive behavior. While normal levels of 5-HT have an inhibitory effect on brain regions involved in aggressive behavior, a reduction in 5-HT activity increases aggression. Genetic factors are involved in the relationship between 5-HT and aggressive behavior and several genetic variants that influence aggressive behavior have been identified. 5-HT effects are mediated by at least 14 receptor subtypes and grouped into seven 5-HT receptor families (5-HT1-5-HT7 receptor). In the brain, 5-HT receptors are distributed pre- and post-synaptically and it is believed that these different subtypes may exert opposing effects on aggressive behavior. Aggressive behavior is influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, including substance use. A high proportion of all crimes are committed under the influence of substances of abuse including alcohol, cannabis, cocaine. In this chapter, we will focus on 5-HT2B receptor and will discuss its role in the modulation of aggressive and impulsive behaviors as well as related traits such as drug abuse.Copyright © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,2021

The sensory (visual, taste and smell) paradigms used in neuroimaging studies represent an ideal platform to investigate the connection between the different neural circuits subserving the reward/executive control systems in these disorders, which may offer a translational mechanism for novel intervention predictions. Thus, the current review provides an integrated summary of the recent neuroimaging studies that have applied cue-reactivity paradigms and neuromodulation strategies to explore underlying alterations in neural circuitry as well in treatment strategies in AUD and obesity. Finally, we discuss literature on mechanisms associated with increased alcohol sensitivity post-bariatric surgery (BS) which offers guidance for future research to use sensory percepts in elucidating the relation of reward signaling in AUD development post-BS.Copyright © 2021",Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews,May-21

Prior work has examined LICI as a putative biomarker in an array of neuropsychiatric disorders. This review conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) sought to examine existing literature focused on LICI as a biomarker in neuropsychiatric disorders. There were 113 articles that met the inclusion criteria. Existing literature suggests that LICI may have utility as a biomarker of GABAB functioning but more research with increased methodologic rigor is needed. The extant LICI literature has heterogenous methodology and inconsistencies in findings. Existing findings to date are also non-specific to disease. Future research should carefully consider existing methodological weaknesses and implement high-quality test-retest reliability studies.© Copyright © 2021 Fatih, Kucuker, Vande Voort, Doruk Camsari, Farzan and Croarkin.",Frontiers in Psychiatry,02-Jun-21

Objective(s): The objectives of this study were to analyze the natural history of ICD between baseline and 1 year after subthalamic DBS in patients with PD and to identify predictive factors, taking into account the positions of the active contact and stimulation parameters. Method(s): We analyzed postoperative modifications of ICD based on the multicentric, prospective Predictive Factors and Subthalamic Stimulation in Parkinson's Disease cohort. ICD status and Ardouin Scale of Behaviour in PD were assessed at baseline and 1 year following subthalamic DBS. Location of active contacts within the 3 subthalamic nucleus functional territories was investigated. Result(s): A total of 217 were patients included. Of the patients, 10.6% had ICD at baseline of which 95.6% improved at 1 year following subthalamic DBS; 3.6% of the patients experienced de novo ICD at 1 year following subthalamic DBS. Dopamine agonist dose reduction (from 309.8 to 109.3 mg) was the main driver of ICD regression (P = 0.05). Higher preoperative dyskinesias were associated with poorer ICD evolution (P = 0.04). Whereas baseline apathy was a risk factor of de novo ICD (P = 0.02), ICD improvement correlated with postoperative apathy (P = 0.004). Stimulation power and position of active contacts-mainly located within the sensorimotor part of the subthalamic nucleus-did not influence ICD. Conclusion(s): This 1-year, postoperative follow-up study showed ICD regression and dopaminergic drug reduction with optimal position of the active contacts within the subthalamic nucleus. Whereas patients with PD with preoperative ICD were prone to postoperative apathy, we also showed that those with preoperative apathy had a higher risk to experience postoperative de novo ICD, further highlighting the meaningful influence of postoperative management of dopaminergic medication on outcome and the continuum between apathy and ICD. © 2020 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",Movement Disorders,Mar-21

Multiple approaches have been used for decades to clarify the neurobiological basis of this disease and to identify novel potential treatments. This review summarizes the main brain networks involved in the vulnerability to addiction and specific innovative technological approaches to investigate these neural circuits. First, the evolution of the definition of addiction across the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) is revised. We next discuss several innovative experimental techniques that, combined with behavioral approaches, have allowed recent critical advances in understanding the neural circuits involved in addiction, including DREADDs, calcium imaging, and electrophysiology. All these techniques have been used to investigate specific neural circuits involved in vulnerability to addiction and have been extremely useful to clarify the neurobiological basis of each specific component of the addictive process. These novel tools targeting specific brain regions are of great interest to further understand the different aspects of this complex disease.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Neuropharmacology,15-Mar-21

Three subjects with myoclonus-dystonia syndrome were surgically treated, one of them with GPi and Vim stimulation, while radiofrequency ablation of these structures was performed in the other 2 subjects. Surgical approach of both targets was performed simultaneously on each subject. Mean follow-up was of 33.3 months (22-48 months), the Unified Myoclonus Rating Scale action myoclonus (AM), functional tests (FT), patient questionnaire (PQ) sub-scores, and the Unified Dystonia Rating Scale (UDRS) were used during assessments. Improvement in all scales were seen 6 months after surgery (AM: 74%, FT: 60%, PQ: 63%, UDRS: 65%), and this benefit persisted throughout follow-up (AM: 61%, FT:62%, PQ: 65%, UDRS: 86%). No adverse events were noticed. Simultaneous unilateral procedures of GPi and Vim by either stimulation or ablation techniques improve both motor and functional scores in myoclonus-dystonia syndrome.Copyright © 2021 S. Karger AG.

striate cortex","Psychiatric illness is a prevalent and highly debilitating disorder, and more than 50% of the general population in both middle- and high-income countries experience at least one psychiatric disorder at some point in their lives. As we continue to learn how pervasive psychiatric episodes are in society, we must acknowledge that psychiatric disorders are not solely relegated to a small group of predisposed individuals but rather occur in significant portions of all societal groups. Several distinct brain regions have been implicated in neuropsychiatric disease. These brain regions include corticolimbic structures, which regulate executive function and decision making (e.g., the prefrontal cortex), as well as striatal subregions known to control motivated behavior under normal and stressful conditions. Importantly, the corticolimbic neural circuitry includes the hippocampus, a critical brain structure that sends projections to both the cortex and striatum to coordinate learning, memory, and mood. In this review, we will discuss past and recent discoveries of how neurobiological processes in the hippocampus and corticolimbic structures work in concert to control executive function, memory, and mood in the context of mental disorders.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).",Experimental and Molecular Medicine,Mar-21

tobacco","The hypothesis issued by modern medicine states that many diseases known to humans are genetically determined, influenced or not by environmental factors, which is applicable to most psychiatric disorders as well. This article focuses on two pending questions regarding addiction: Why do some individuals become addicted while others do not? along with Is it a learned behavior or is it genetically predefined? Recent data suggest that addiction is more than repeated exposure, it is the synchronicity between intrinsic factors (genotype, sex, age, preexisting addictive disorder, or other mental illness), extrinsic factors (childhood, level of education, socioeconomic status, social support, entourage, drug availability) and the nature of the addictive agent (pharmacokinetics, path of administration, psychoactive properties). The dopamine.mesolimbic motivation.reward.reinforcement cycle remains the most coherent physiological theory in addiction. While the common property of addictive substances is that they are dopamine.agonists, each class has individual mechanisms, pharmacokinetics and psychoactive potentials.Copyright © 2021 Spandidos Publications.

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and cannabis use disorder (CUD) are associated with poorer decision-making in adolescents. In adolescents, level of AUD symptomatology has been negatively associated with striatal reward responsivity. However, little work has explored the relationship with striatal reward prediction error (RPE) representation and the extent to which any augmentation of RPE by novel stimuli is impacted. One-hundred fifty-one adolescents participated in the Novelty Task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In this task, participants learn to choose novel or non-novel stimuli to gain monetary reward. Level of AUD symptomatology was negatively associated with both optimal decision-making and BOLD response modulation by RPE within striatum and regions of prefrontal cortex. The neural alterations in RPE representation were particularly pronounced when participants were exploring novel stimuli. Level of CUD symptomatology moderated the relationship between novelty propensity and RPE representation within inferior parietal lobule and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. These data expand on an emerging literature investigating individual associations of AUD symptomatology levels versus CUD symptomatology levels and RPE representation during reinforcement processing and provide insight on the role of neuro-computational processes underlying reinforcement learning/decision-making in adolescents.Copyright © 2021 The Authors",Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience,Apr-21

variable number of tandem repeat","Background: Impulse control disorders (ICDs) are a frequent side effect of dopamine replacement therapy (DRT) in Parkinson's disease (PD). Reckless generosity might expand the spectrum of known ICDs. Cases: Over 18 months, we encountered three PD patients exhibiting reckless generosity under DRT, leading to disastrous financial and social consequences. Literature Review: Except for another case series describing reckless generosity in three PD patients, only one study has examined generosity in PD patients; with findings suggesting that PD patients with ICDs are less sensitive to the aversive aspects of the lack of reciprocation in social settings. Studies with healthy individuals suggest that increased availability of dopamine might reduce social discounting and promote egalitarian behavior, and thereby increase generous behavior towards strangers. Genetic studies show that polymorphisms in dopamine D4 receptors influence generous behavior. Conclusion(s): Reckless generosity in PD patients with DRT might be underreported and should therefore be carefully be screened for by clinicians. A potential mechanism underlying this ICD-related behavior might be a sensitization of the mesolimbic and mesocortical dopaminergic system, leading to reduced social discounting and maladaptive reward-learning. Further research is needed to investigate the prevalence and underlying mechanisms of reckless generosity in PD patients.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale","Background: Dopamine Dysregulation Syndrome (DDS) is an adverse non-motor complication of dopamine replacement therapy in Parkinson's disease. The current literature on this syndrome is limited, and it remains underdiagnosed and challenging to manage. Objective(s): To assess the role of advanced therapies in the management of DDS. Method(s): We performed a retrospective chart review and identified patients who fit the inclusion criteria for DDS. They were classified according to risk factors that have been identified in the literature, motor and complication scores, intervention (medical or surgical) and outcome. Multivariate analyses were performed to analyze these characteristics. Result(s): Twenty-seven patients were identified (23 males, mean age of onset: 49 +/- 8.8 years). Average levodopa equivalent daily dose was 1916.7 +/- 804 mg and a history of impulse control disorders, psychiatric illness, and substance abuse was present in 89%, 70% and 3.7% of the patients, respectively. Overall 81.5% of patients had symptom resolution at follow up, on average 4.8 +/- 3.5 years after management, with medication only (7/9), levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (1/3), deep brain stimulation of subthalamic nucleus (10/13), or globus pallidus pars interna (2/2). Reduction of medications occurred with deep brain stimulation of subthalamic nucleus (P = 0.01) but was associated with a relapse in two patients. Conclusion(s): Although the small sample size of some subgroups limits our ability to draw meaningful conclusions, our results did not suggest superiority of a single treatment option. Advanced therapies including deep brain stimulation can be considered in patients with DDS refractory to conservative measures, but outcome is variable and relapse is possible.Copyright © 2021 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society",Movement Disorders Clinical Practice,Apr-21

While current therapies for PD include pharma-cological, invasive, and physical interventions, there is a constant need for developing additional approaches for optimizing rehabilitation gains. Mental imagery is an emerging field in neuroreha-bilitation and has the potential to serve as an adjunct therapy to enhance patient function. Yet, the literature on this topic is sparse. The current paper reviews the motor, sensorimotor, and sensory domains impacted by PD using gait, balance, and pain as examples, respectively. Then, mental imagery and its potential for PD motor and non-motor rehabilitation is discussed, with an emphasis on its suitability for addressing gait, balance, and pain deficits in people with PD. Lastly, future research directions are suggested.Copyright © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Brain Sciences,Feb-21

It also seeks to illuminate areas in need of further investigation. Recent Findings: There is a paucity of professional guidelines and clinical trials on this topic, despite the disproportionate rates of preexisting opioid use and chronic pain in trauma patients, and the contributions of these issues to inferior outcomes. The management of these patients is complex, requiring knowledge of opioid conversions, medication-assisted treatment (MAT), and non-opioid analgesic options. Summary: Provider education, standardized assessments and screening tools, evolving multidisciplinary approach, careful management of pre-injury therapy, use of non-opioid adjuvant therapies, early discharge planning, and close follow-up are essential to achieving adequate acute pain control in these patients, which can contribute to better short- and long-term outcomes.Copyright © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Current Trauma Reports,Mar-21

The craving of substances leads to relapse in the majority of patients within one year of traditional treatments. In recent decades, neuromodulation approaches have emerged as potential novel treatments of SUD, but the ideal neural target remains contentious. Material(s) and Method(s): In this review, we discuss new insights on the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) as a neuromodulation target for SUD. Results and Conclusion(s): First, we illustrate that the ACC serves as a central ""hub"" in addiction-related neural networks of cognitive functions, including, but not limited to, decision-making, cognitive inhibition, emotion, and motivation. Then, we summarize the literature targeting the ACC to treat SUDs via available neuromodulation approaches. Finally, we propose potential directions to improve the effect of stimulating the ACC in SUD treatment. We emphasize that the ACC can be divided into at least four sub-regions, which have distinctive functions and connections. Studies focusing on these sub-regions may help to develop more precise and effective ACC stimulation according to patients' symptom profiles and cognitive deficits.Copyright © 2020 International Neuromodulation Society",Neuromodulation,Feb-21

Aiming to increase its efficacy, tDCS has been combined with psychological interventions. Our state-of-the-art overview of such combined treatment trials indicates, however, that these usually do not elicit synergistic clinical effects. We therefore explored more basic mechanisms related to the brain state-dependency of tDCS. Importantly, based on our overview, the efficacy of combined interventions may depend on whether individual patients present with endophenotypes that are implicated in the development and maintenance of psychopathology, such as prefrontal-mediated cognitive dysfunction. We discuss how future studies may contribute to the development of personally-tailored dual active treatments by adhering to the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework. RDoC-based mechanistic research may reveal alternative neural circuits that should be functionally targeted by both tDCS and psychological interventions, with promising avenues for clinical psychological science and practice.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Biological Psychology,Jan-21

transcranial magnetic stimulation","Introduction: Despite intense neuroscience research on the neurobiological underpinnings of Gambling Disorder (GD) and gambling-related decision-making, effective treatments targeting these dysfunctions are still lacking. Non Invasive Brain Stimulation (NIBS) techniques, such as transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), selectively modulate activity of brain circuits and have the potential to reverse alterations sustaining GD symptoms. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to determine the impact of different NIBS interventions on gambling-related decision processes. Method(s): We conducted a comprehensive and translational search in three online databases (MEDLINE via PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science), in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. We included studies applying neuromodulation (TMS, tDCS) techniques in GD patients or assessing gambling-related decision-making in healthy subjects. In addition, we explored the potential impact of NIBS in drug-induced GD (e.g., Parkinson's Disease). Result(s): Twenty-seven studies have been included. We summarized results to detect the impact of different targets and stimulation/inhibition protocols in terms of gambling-related decision-making. The majority of both tDCS and TMS studies targeted the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Although heterogeneous in protocols and parameters, results from tDCS and TMS studies converge in indicating that the stimulation (instead of inhibition) of prefrontal regions could be beneficial to contrast dysfunctional gambling-related decision processes. Conclusion(s): NIBS interventions show promise to be further tested in controlled clinical settings for the treatment of behavioral addictions. Further studies are also necessary to investigate connectivity changes and laterality issues (unilateral versus bilateral; left versus right) of NIBS application in GD.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Addictive Behaviors,Jan-21

Therefore, maladaptive drug memories supporting drug-seeking and relapse behaviours may present novel treatment targets for therapeutic approaches based upon reconsolidation-blockade. It is known that different structures within the limbic corticostriatal system contribute differentially to different types of maladaptive drug memories, including pavlovian associations between environmental cues and contexts with the drug high, and instrumental memories underlying drug-seeking. Here, we review the mechanisms underlying drug memory reconsolidation in the amygdala, striatum, and hippocampus, noting similarities and differences, and opportunities for future research.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Current Opinion in Pharmacology,Feb-21

waist circumference","The dopamine D4 receptor (DRD4) has a predominant expression in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), brain area strictly involved in the modulation of reward processes related to both food and drug consumption. Additionally, the human DRD4 gene is characterized by a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) in the exon 3 and, among the polymorphic variants, the 7-repeat (7R) allele appears as a contributing factor in the neurobiological mechanisms underlying drug abuse, aberrant eating behaviors and related comorbidities. The 7R variant encodes for a receptor with a blunted intracellular response to dopamine, and carriers of this polymorphism might be more tempted to enhance dopamine levels in the brain, through the overconsumption of drugs of abuse or palatable food, considering their reinforcing properties. Moreover, the presence of this polymorphism seems to increase the susceptibility of individuals to engage maladaptive eating patterns in response to negative environmental stimuli. This review is focused on the role of DRD4 and DRD4 genetic polymorphism in these neuropsychiatric disorders in both clinical and preclinical studies. However, further research is needed to better clarify the complex DRD4 role, by using validated preclinical models and novel compounds more selective for DRD4.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

*repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation","Importance: Impulsivity during periods of abstinence is a critical symptom of patients who use methamphetamine (MA). Objective(s): To evaluate changes in impulse inhibition elicited by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in patients with MA addiction. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This randomized clinical trial was conducted in Da Lian Shan Addiction Rehabilitation Center, Nanjing, China, from December 1, 2018, to April 20, 2019. Effects of the intervention were examined at 3 time points: after a single session (day 1), 24 hours after 10 repeated sessions (day 11), and at 3 weeks of follow-up (day 31). Men with MA addiction and healthy male control participants were recruited for this study. Data analysis was performed from March 2019 to October 2019. Intervention(s): Patients who use MA were randomized to undergo sham rTMS (36 patients) and or 1-Hz rTMS (37 patients) to the left prefrontal cortex, receiving daily TMS treatments for 10 consecutive days. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was impulse inhibition, which is primarily embodied by accuracy reduction (ie, accuracy cost) from standard to deviant trials in a 2-choice oddball task (80% standard and 20% deviant trials). Result(s): The study included 73 men with MA addiction (mean [SD] age, 38.49 [7.69] years) and 33 male healthy control participants without MA addiction (mean [SD] age, 35.15 [9.68] years). The mean (SD) duration of abstinence for the men with MA addiction was 9.27 (4.61) months. Compared with the control group, patients with MA addiction exhibited greater impulsivity (accuracy cost, 3.3% vs 6.2%). The single session of 1-Hz rTMS over the left prefrontal cortex significantly increased accuracy from 91.4% to 95.7% (F1,36 = 9.58; P <.001) and reaction time delay from 50 milliseconds to 77 milliseconds (F1,36 = 22.66; P <.001) in deviant trials. These effects were seen consistently after 10 sessions of 1-Hz rTMS treatment (day 11 vs day 1, t26 = 1.59; P =.12), and the behavioral improvement was maintained at least for 3 weeks after treatment (day 31 vs day 1, t26 = 0.26; P =.80). These improvement effects of impulse inhibition were coupled with a reduction in addictive symptoms as measured by cue-induced craving. The pretest accuracy cost was positively correlated with the change in impulse inhibition (r = 0.615; P <.001) and change in craving (r = 0.334; P =.01), suggesting that these 2 behaviors may be modified simultaneously. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that repeated rTMS sessions have sustained effects on impulse inhibition in patients with MA addiction and provide novel data on impulsivity management strategies for addiction rehabilitation.

Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale","Dopaminergic medications administered to remedy motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease are associated with an enhanced risk for impulse control disorders (ICD) and related compulsive behaviors (ICD-RB). Thus, the present study focuses on investigating the gender difference in the prevalence of ICD-RBs in Indian PD patients on dopamine replacement therapy (DRT), its impact on quality of life and to identify ICDs relevant in Indian scenario apart from the criteria set in QUIP-RS. Method(s): This was a hospital-based observational cross-sectional study in which Parkinson's disease patients attending neurology clinic were included. Complete details of anti-parkinsonian therapy along with demographic and clinical variables were recorded on a predesigned Performa. Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson's disease (QUIP), which is a validated quick screening tool, was used to detect ICD-RBs. The relative frequency and comparative impact of ICD on health-related quality of life (QOL) was studied using validated PDQ-39 Questionnaire. Result(s): Out of 102 patients, at least one ICD or ICD-RB was present in 41.19% and >=2 ICD-RBs were present in 15.59%. At least one ICD was present in 16.67%, any ICD-related compulsive behaviors was present in 34.31% patients. The most common was punding and compulsive medication use (12.75% each), followed by hobbyism (7.84%), compulsive eating (6.86%), pathological gambling (3.92%), and hypersexuality, walkabout, and compulsive shopping (2.94% each). ICDs not classified elsewhere such as trichotillomania were found 3 patients (2.94%). ICD-RBs showed a trend to be more frequent in women (44.82% women vs. 39.39% men). As compared with patients without ICD-RBs, those with ICD-RBs were found to have higher dose of LD and DA and higher Hoehn and Yahr stage. ICD-RBs have a negative impact on the quality of life of Parkinson's disease patients. Conclusion(s): ICDs and ICD-RBs have been included in the behavioral spectrum of nonmotor symptoms in PD. PD patients are at increased risk of developing ICD-RBs which interfere with important activities and have obligation in ordinary life, leading to legal and psychological consequences with a great impact on QOL.Copyright © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

working memory","Tobacco smoking is highly prevalent among HIV-infected individuals. Chronic smokers with HIV showed greater cognitive deficits and impulsivity, and had more psychopathological symptoms and greater neuroinflammation than HIV non-smokers or smokers without HIV infection. However, preclinical studies that evaluated the combined effects of HIV-infection and tobacco smoking are scare. The preclinical models typically used cell cultures or animal models that involved specific HIV viral proteins or the administration of nicotine to rodents. These preclinical models consistently demonstrated that nicotine had neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects, leading to cognitive enhancement. Although the major addictive ingredient in tobacco smoking is nicotine, chronic smoking does not lead to improved cognitive function in humans. Therefore, preclinical studies designed to unravel the interactive effects of chronic tobacco smoking and HIV infection are needed. In this review, we summarized the preclinical studies that demonstrated the neuroprotective effects of nicotine, the neurotoxic effects of the HIV viral proteins, and the scant literature on nicotine or tobacco smoke in HIV transgenic rat models. We also reviewed the clinical studies that evaluated the neurotoxic effects of tobacco smoking, HIV infection and their combined effects on the brain, including studies that evaluated the cognitive and behavioral assessments, as well as neuroimaging measures. Lastly, we compared the different approaches between preclinical and clinical studies, identified some gaps and proposed some future directions.

Since the NAc is connected with the motor system, we tested whether phase and amplitude-based NAc-cortical connectivity and power modulation likewise underlie flexibility in motor action control. We combined concurrently recorded intracranial and extracranial electroencephalograms from seven psychiatric patients implanted with deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes who performed a stop signal task (SST). Inhibition success, as opposed to failure, was associated with greater prestimulus information flow from right NAc to medial frontal cortex through phase coupling of u oscillations. Inhibition failure evoked u power increases in the left NAc and medial frontal cortex, whereas pari-eto-occipital cortex showed an alpha power decrease. We conclude that NAc-to-frontal u connectivity, possibly facilitating processing of task-relevant information, and a and u power modulations, possibly reflecting posterror engagement of cognitive control, contribute to adaptive behavior pertaining motor control.Copyright © 2020 Eijsker et al.",eNeuro,2020

Children with LDs experience substantial working memory (WM) deficits, even more pronounced if more than one of the academic skills is affected. We compared the task-related electroencephalogram (EEG) power spectral density of children with LDs (n = 23) with a control group of children with good academic achievement (n = 22), during the performance of a WM task. sLoreta was used to estimate the current distribution at the sources, and 18 brain regions of interest (ROIs) were chosen with an extended version of the eigenvector centrality mapping technique. In this way, we lessened some drawbacks of the traditional EEG at the sensor space by an analysis at the brain-sources level over data-driven selected ROIs. Result(s): The LD group showed fewer correct responses in the WM task, an overall slower EEG with more delta and theta activity, and less high-frequency gamma activity in posterior areas. We explain these EEG patterns in LD children as indices of an inefficient neural resource management related with a delay in neural maturation.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

sensorimotor function

ventral tegmentum","The traditional cerebellum's role has been linked to the high computational demands for sensorimotor control. However, several findings have pointed to its involvement in executive and emotional functions in the last decades. First in 2009 and then, in 2016, we raised why we should consider the cerebellum when thinking about drug addiction. A decade later, mounting evidence strongly suggests the cerebellar involvement in this disorder. Nevertheless, direct evidence is still partial and related mainly to drug-induced reward memory, but recent results about cerebellar functions may provide new insights into its role in addiction. The present review does not intend to be a compelling revision on available findings, as we did in the two previous reviews. This minireview focuses on specific findings of the cerebellum's role in drug-related reward memories and the way ahead for future research. The results discussed here provide grounds for involving the cerebellar cortex's apical region in regulating behavior driven by drug-cue associations. They also suggest that the cerebellar cortex dysfunction may facilitate drug-induced learning by increasing glutamatergic output from the deep cerebellar nucleus (DCN) to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and neural activity in its projecting areas.© Copyright © 2020 Miquel, Gil-Miravet and Guarque-Chabrera.",Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience,21-Oct-20

ubiquitination","The endocannabinoid (eCB) system is a lipid-based neurotransmitter complex that plays crucial roles in the neural control of learning and memory. The current model of eCB-mediated retrograde signaling is that eCBs released from postsynaptic elements travel retrogradely to presynaptic axon terminals, where they activate cannabinoid type-1 receptors (CB1Rs) and ultimately decrease neurotransmitter release on a short- or long-term scale. An increasing body of evidence has enlarged this view and shows that eCBs, besides depressing synaptic transmission, are also able to increase neurotransmitter release at multiple synapses of the brain. This indicates that eCBs act as bidirectional regulators of synaptic transmission and plasticity. Recently, studies unveiled links between the expression of eCB-mediated long-term potentiation (eCB-LTP) and learning, and between its dysregulation and several pathologies. In this review article, we first distinguish the various forms of eCB-LTP based on their mechanisms, resulting from homosynaptically or heterosynaptically-mediated processes. Next, we consider the neuromodulation of eCB-LTP, its behavioral impact on learning and memory, and finally, eCB-LTP disruptions in various pathologies and its potential as a therapeutic target in disorders such as stress coping, addiction, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, and pain. Cannabis is gaining popularity as a recreational substance as well as a medicine, and multiple eCB-based drugs are under development. In this context, it is critical to understand eCB-mediated signaling in its multi-faceted complexity. Indeed, the bidirectional nature of eCB-based neuromodulation may offer an important key to interpret the functions of the eCB system and how it is impacted by cannabis and other drugs.© Copyright © 2020 Piette, Cui, Gervasi and Venance.",Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience,28-Jul-20

technology","Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is one of the most important clinical therapies for neurological disorders. DBS also has great potential to become a great tool for clinical neuroscience research. Recently, the National Engineering Laboratory for Neuromodulation at Tsinghua University held an international Deep Brain Stimulation Initiative workshop to discuss the cutting-edge technological achievements and clinical applications of DBS. We specifically addressed new clinical approaches and challenges in DBS for movement disorders (Parkinson's disease and dystonia), clinical application toward neurorehabilitation for stroke, and the progress and challenges toward DBS for neuropsychiatric disorders. This review highlighted key developments in (1) neuroimaging, with advancements in 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging DBS compatibility for exploration of brain network mechanisms; (2) novel DBS recording capabilities for uncovering disease pathophysiology; and (3) overcoming global healthcare burdens with online-based DBS programming technology for connecting patient communities. The successful event marks a milestone for global collaborative opportunities in clinical development of neuromodulation to treat major neurological disorders.© Copyright © 2021 Sui, Tian, Ko, Wang, Jia, Horn, De Ridder, Choi, Bari, Wang, Hamani, Baker, Machado, Aziz, Fonoff, Kuhn, Bergman, Sanger, Liu, Haber and Li.",Frontiers in Neurology,28-Jan-21

*virus infection","The loss of the senses of smell (anosmia) and taste (ageusia) are rather common disorders, affecting up to 20% of the adult population. Yet, this condition has not received the attention it deserves, most probably because per se such a disorder is not life threatening. However, loss of olfactory function significantly reduces the quality of life of the affected patients, leading to dislike in food and insufficient, exaggerated or unbalanced food intake, unintentional exposure to toxins such as household gas, social isolation, depression, and an overall insecurity. Not only is olfactory dysfunction rather prevalent in the healthy population, it is, in many instances, also a correlate or an early indicator of a panoply of diseases. Importantly, olfactory dysfunction is linked to the two most prominent neurodegenerative disorders, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Anosmia and hyposmia (reduced sense of smell) affect a majority of patients years before the onset of cognitive or motor symptoms, establishing olfactory dysfunction as early biomarker that can enable earlier diagnosis and preventative treatments. In the current health crisis caused by SARS-CoV2, anosmia and dysgeusia as early-onset symptoms in virus-positive patients may prove to be highly relevant and crucial for pre-symptomatic Covid-19 detection from a public health perspective, preceding by days the more classical respiratory tract symptoms such as cough, tightness of the chest or fever. Thus, the olfactory system seems to be at the frontline of pathologic assault, be it through pathogens or insults that can lead to or at least associate with neurodegeneration. The aim of this review is to assemble current knowledge from different medical fields that all share a common denominator, olfactory/gustatory dysfunction, and to distill overarching etiologies and disease progression mechanisms.© Copyright © 2020 Rebholz, Braun, Ladage, Knoll, Kleber and Hassel.",Frontiers in Neurology,26-Oct-20

One such approach involves neuromodulation which has been used therapeutically for neurological and psychiatric disorders and has demonstrated positive preliminary findings for the treatment of substance use disorder. The following article provides a review of several forms of neuromodulation which warrant consideration as potential treatments for substance use disorder. PubMed, PsycINFO, Ovid MEDLINE, and Web of Science were used to identify published articles and clinicaltrials.gov was used to identify currently ongoing or planned studies. Search criteria for Brain Stimulation included the following terminology: transcranial direct current stimulation, transcranial magnetic stimulation, theta burst stimulation, deep brain stimulation, vagus nerve stimulation, trigeminal nerve stimulation, percutaneous nerve field stimulation, auricular nerve stimulation, and low intensity focused ultrasound. Search criteria for Addiction included the following terminology: addiction, substance use disorder, substance-related disorder, cocaine, methamphetamine, amphetamine, alcohol, nicotine, tobacco, smoking, marijuana, cannabis, heroin, opiates, opioids, and hallucinogens. Results revealed that there are currently several forms of neuromodulation, both invasive and non-invasive, which are being investigated for the treatment of substance use disorder. Preliminary findings have demonstrated the potential of these various neuromodulation techniques in improving substance treatment outcomes by reducing those risk factors (e.g. substance craving) associated with relapse. Specifically, transcranial magnetic stimulation has shown the most promise with several well-designed studies supporting the potential for reducing substance craving. Deep brain stimulation has also shown promise, though lacks well-controlled clinical trials to support its efficacy. Transcranial direct current stimulation has also demonstrated promising results though consistently designed, randomized trials are also needed. There are several other forms of neuromodulation which have not yet been investigated clinically but warrant further investigation given their mechanisms and potential efficacy based on findings from other studied indications. In summary, given promising findings in reducing substance use and craving, neuromodulation may provide a non-pharmacological option as a potential treatment and/or treatment augmentation for substance use disorder. Further research investigating neuromodulation, both alone and in combination with already established substance use disorder treatment (e.g. medication treatment), warrants consideration.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Journal of the Neurological Sciences,15-Nov-20

Review

systematic review","Objectives: Several evidence-based interventions exist for people who misuse opioids, but there is limited guidance on optimal intervention selection. Economic evaluations using simulation modeling can guide the allocation of resources and help tackle the opioid crisis. This study reviews methods employed by economic evaluations using computer simulations to investigate the health and economic effects of interventions meant to address opioid misuse. Method(s): We conducted a systematic mapping review of studies that used simulation modeling to support the economic evaluation of interventions targeting prevention, treatment, or management of opioid misuse or its direct consequences (ie, overdose). We searched 6 databases and extracted information on study population, interventions, costs, outcomes, and economic analysis and modeling approaches. Result(s): Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria. All of the studies considered only one segment of the continuum of care. Of the studies, 13 evaluated medications for opioid use disorder, and 5 evaluated naloxone distribution programs to reduce overdose deaths. Most studies estimated incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-years and used health system and/or societal perspectives. Models were decision trees (n = 4), Markov (n = 10) or semi-Markov models (n = 3), and microsimulations (n = 1). All of the studies assessed parameter uncertainty though deterministic and/or probabilistic sensitivity analysis, 4 conducted formal calibration, only 2 assessed structural uncertainty, and only 1 conducted expected value of information analyses. Only 10 studies conducted validation. Conclusion(s): Future economic evaluations should consider synergies between interventions and examine combinations of interventions to inform optimal policy response. They should also more consistently conduct model validation and assess the value of further research.Copyright © 2020 ISPOR-The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research",Value in Health,Aug-20

human","Alcohol dependence is one of the psychiatric disorders affecting over 1 million people in Japan. Mesolimbic dopamine neuron projecting from ventral tegmental area to nucleus accumbens (Reward system) plays important roles in alcohol dependence including other dependence. Accumulating evidence indicates that the endogenous opioid system regulate this reward system. That is, alcohol stimulates the release of endogenous opioid peptides such as beta-endorphin and dynorphin in the brain. beta-endorphin activates mu-opioid receptor leading to euphoric mood and positive reinforcement, while dynorphin activates kappa-opioid receptor leading to dysphoric mood and negative reinforcement. These euphoric/dysphoric mood and reinforcement effects via endogenous opioid systems are suggested to be implicated in repeated alcohol intake in patients with alcohol dependence. Nalmefene acts as an antagonist at mu-and delta-opioid receptor and a partial agonist at kappa-opioid receptor. Preclinical studies have shown that nalmefene reduced the alcohol intake in alcohol preference rats. In clinical trials, as-needed use of nalmefene with psychosocial support reduced the number of heavy-drinking days and total alcohol consumption. These results suggest that nalmefene modulates the alcohol-induced euphoric/dysphoric mood via opioid system and thereby contribute to reduction in alcohol consumption in patients with alcohol dependence. Here, we summarize the implications of opioid system in alcohol dependence and pharmacological profiles of nalmefene in preclinical and clinical studies.Copyright © 2020, Japanese Pharmacological Society.

Review

signal transduction","The comorbidity of depression and addiction has become a serious public health issue, and the relationship between these two disorders and their potential mechanisms has attracted extensive attention. Numerous studies have suggested that depression and addiction share common mechanisms and anatomical pathways. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) has long been considered a key brain region for regulating many behaviors, especially those related to depression and addiction. In this review article, we focus on the association between addiction and depression, highlighting the potential mediating role of the NAc in this comorbidity via the regulation of changes in the neural circuits and molecular signaling. To clarify the mechanisms underlying this association, we summarize evidence from overlapping reward neurocircuitry, the resemblance of cellular and molecular mechanisms, and common treatments. Understanding the interplay between these disorders should help guide clinical comorbidity prevention and the search for a new target for comorbidity treatment.© Copyright © 2020 Xu, Nan and Lan.",Frontiers in Neural Circuits,30-Jun-20

Effective therapeutic interventions for GD are lacking. Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) may represent a promising treatment option for GD. Objective(s): This systematic review aimed to provide a comprehensive and structured overview of studies applying NIBS techniques to GD and problem gambling. Method(s): A literature search using Pubmed, Web of Science, and Science Direct was conducted from databases inception to December 19, 2019, for studies assessing the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (t-DCS) on subjects with GD or problem gambling. Studies using NIBS techniques on healthy subjects and those without therapeutic goals but only aiming to assess basic neurophysiology measures were excluded. Result(s): A total of 269 articles were title and abstract screened, 13 full texts were assessed, and 11 were included, of which six were controlled and five were uncontrolled. Most studies showed a reduction of gambling behavior, craving for gambling, and gambling-related symptoms. NIBS effects on psychiatric symptoms were less consistent. A decrease of the behavioral activation related to gambling was also reported. Some studies reported modulation of behavioral measures (i.e., impulsivity, cognitive and attentional control, decision making, cognitive flexibility). Studies were not consistent in terms of NIBS protocol, site of stimulation, clinical and surrogate outcome measures, and duration of treatment and follow-up. Sample size was small in most studies. Conclusion(s): The clinical and methodological heterogeneity of the included studies prevented us from drawing any firm conclusion on the efficacy of NIBS interventions for GD. Further methodologically sound, robust, and well-powered studies are needed.© Copyright © 2020 Zucchella, Mantovani, Federico, Lugoboni and Tamburin.",Frontiers in Neuroscience,18-Aug-20

This review reveals that fornix damage causes cognitive deficits that closely mirror those resulting from hippocampal lesions. Method(s): We reviewed the literature on the fornix, spanning non-human animal lesion research, clinical case studies of human patients with fornix damage, as well as diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) work that evaluates fornix microstructure in vivo. Result(s): The fornix is essential for memory formation because it serves as the conduit for theta rhythms and acetylcholine, as well as providing mnemonic representations to deep brain structures that guide motivated behavior, such as when and where to eat. In rodents and non-human primates, fornix lesions lead to deficits in conditioning, reversal learning, and navigation. In humans, damage to the fornix manifests as anterograde amnesia. DWI research reveals that the fornix plays a key role in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's Disease, and can potentially predict conversion from the former to the latter. Emerging DWI findings link perturbations in this structure to schizophrenia, mood disorders, and eating disorders. Cutting-edge research has investigated how deep brain stimulation of the fornix can potentially attenuate memory loss, control epileptic seizures, and even improve mood. Conclusion(s): The fornix is essential to a fully functioning memory system and is implicated in nearly all neurological functions that rely on the hippocampus. Future research needs to use optimized DWI methods to study the fornix in vivo, which we discuss, given the difficult nature of fornix reconstruction. The fornix is a white matter tract that connects the hippocampus to several subcortical brain regions and is pivotal for episodic memory functioning. Functionally, the fornix transmits essential neurotransmitters, as well as theta rhythms, to the hippocampus. In addition, it is the conduit by which memories guide decisions. The fornix is biomedically important because lesions to this tract result in irreversible anterograde amnesia. Research using in vivo imaging methods has linked fornix pathology to cognitive aging, mild cognitive impairment, psychosis, epilepsy, and, importantly, Alzheimer's Disease.© Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Brain Connectivity,Sep-20

Young Mania Rating Scale","Background: Drug addiction is one of the most prevalent and costly health problems worldwide. Over the past decade, deep brain stimulation (DBS) has increasingly been used for the treatment of drug addiction. Simultaneous DBS of nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC) has successfully been used for preventing heroin relapse. However, the excessive energy consumption speeds up battery depletion, which puts a burden on patients. By comparison, anterior capsulotomy is usually more convenient for patients and its clinical efficacy is similar to that of ALIC DBS. Accordingly, NAc DBS combined with anterior capsulotomy may also be an effective, yet more convenient, intervention for drug addiction and relapse prevention. Case Description: The patient was a 28-year-old man with a polysubstance use disorder (bucinnazine, morphine, and hypnotics) for 13 years. After bilateral NAc DBS combined with bilateral anterior capsulotomy, his craving for the three drugs decreased markedly, and he remained abstinent throughout the follow-up period of approximately 1-year. Moreover, psychiatric and neuropsychological assessments showed significant improvements in depression, anxiety, sleep, quality of life, and most aspects of cognitive functioning. His overall health status was also improved. Conclusion(s): NAc DBS combined with anterior capsulotomy is a promising surgical treatment for drug addiction.© 2020 S. Karger AG, Basel.

transcranial direct current stimulation","Substance-related disorders are psychiatric conditions that have a worldwide impact. Their multifactorial cycle has been treated pharmacologically and with therapeutic support. However, high refractoriness rates and difficulty to control relapses are among the pitfalls associated with these disorders. Thus, recent studies have shown that deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a promising treatment, with a direct intervention in the neurocircuitry of addiction. The results of the present systematic review of the use of DBS for the treatment of drug addiction show that this surgical procedure can reduce the desire for the drug, and, in some cases, establish abstinence, improve psychiatric symptoms related to mood and quality of life, and reintroduce the patient into the social and family environments. Nevertheless, this approach is still limited to the academic realm, based mainly on case reports, with ethics and therapeutic protocols still to be defined. Further in-depth scientific investigations are required to recommend its clinical application.Copyright © 2020 by Thieme Revinter Publicacoes Ltda, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.",Brazilian Neurosurgery,01-Jun-20

withdrawal syndrome","Background: There is a great public health need to identify novel treatment strategies for opioid use disorder (OUD) in order to reduce relapse and overdose. Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) has demonstrated preliminary effectiveness for substance use, but little is known about its use in OUD. Neuromodulation may represent a potential adjunctive treatment modality for OUD, so we conducted a systematic review to understand the state of the current research in this field. Method(s): We conducted a systematic review of studies using noninvasive brain stimulation to affect clinical outcomes related to substance use for adults with opioid use disorder. We searched the following online databases: PubMed, The Cochrane Library, PsycINFO (EBSCOhost, 1872-present), and Science Citation Index Expanded (ISI Web of Science, 1945-present). All studies that measured clinical outcomes related to substance use, including cue-induced craving, were included. We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane Handbook. Result(s): The initial search yielded 5590 studies after duplicates were removed. After screening titles and abstracts, 14 full-text studies were assessed for eligibility. Five studies were determined to meet inclusion criteria with a combined total subjects of N = 150. Given the paucity of studies and small number of total subjects, no quantitative analysis was performed. These studies used TMS (n = 3), tDCS (n = 1), and the BRIDGE device (n = 1), a noninvasive percutaneous electrical nerve field stimulator, to reduce cue-induced craving (n = 3), reduce clinical withdrawal symptoms (n = 1), or measure substance-use-related cortical plasticity (n = 1). Conclusion(s): There is a dearth of research in the area of noninvasive brain stimulation for OUD. NIBS represents a novel treatment modality that should be further investigated for OUD.Copyright © 2020 International Neuromodulation Society",Neuromodulation,01-Apr-20

systematic review","Background: Cannabinoids may have an important therapeutic potential for the treatment of dependence on crack cocaine. Cannabidiol (CBD), in particular, has anxiolytic, antipsychotic and anticonvulsant properties and plays a role in regulating motivation circuitry and controlling sleep disorders. Several studies were performed evaluating CBD in experimental models for cocaine. This systematic review aims evaluate the potential use of CBD in the treatment of cocaine use disorder. Method(s): Five databases (Scielo; Medline/PubMed; PsycINFO; Cochrane Library; Virtual Health Library-VHL) were searched up to January 2020. Full-text reports published in English were included if they were experimental studies that administered CBD to human and/or adult animals in use or with a history of crack/cocaine administration. The risk of bias of each study selected was appraised by two independent reviewers following the Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation (SYRCLE) protocol. Major findings: Fifty-one studies were analyzed, and 14 were selected. No studies conducted with humans were found; only one clinical trial was ongoing. The results were grouped into the following categories: cocaine self-administration, brain-stimulation reward, conditioned place preference, neuronal proliferation, anxiety, hepatic protection, anticonvulsant effect and locomotor sensitization response Only four studies had a low risk of bias. CBD promotes reduction on cocaine self-administration. Also, it interferes in cocaine induce brain reward stimulation and dopamine release. CBD promotes alteration in contextual memory associated with cocaine and in the neuroadaptations, hepatotoxicity and seizures induced by cocaine. Conclusion(s): The evidence indicates that CBD is a promising adjunct therapy for the treatment of cocaine dependence due to its effect on: cocaine reward effects, cocaine consumption, behavioral responses, anxiety, neuronal proliferation, hepatic protection and safety. Moreover, clinical trials are strongly required to determine whether the findings in animal models occur in humans diagnosed for cocaine or crack cocaine use disorder.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior,Sep-20

Yale Food Addiction Scale","The aim of this perspective is to propose and discuss the integration of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex with virtual reality (VR) food exposure for therapeutic interventions for food addiction. ""Food addiction"" is a dysfunctional eating pattern which is typically observed in eating disorders (ED) such as bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder. Food addiction has been compared to substance use disorder due to the necessity of consuming a substance (food) and the presence of a dependence behavior. In recent years, VR has been applied in the treatment of ED because it triggers psychological and physiological responses through food exposure in place of real stimuli. Virtual reality-Cue exposure therapy has been proven as a valid technique for regulating anxiety and food craving in ED. More, TMS has been proven to modulate circuits and networks implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders and is effective in treating addiction such as nicotine craving and consumption and cocaine use disorder. The combination of a simulative technology and a neurostimulation would presumably provide better improvement compared to a single intervention because it implies the presence of both cognitive and neuropsychological techniques. The possible advantage of this approach will be discussed in the perspective.© Copyright © 2020 Stramba-Badiale, Mancuso, Cavedoni, Pedroli, Cipresso and Riva.",Frontiers in Neuroscience,14-Jul-20

working memory","Glutamate is a crucial neurotransmitter of the mammalian central nervous system, a molecular component of our diet, and a popular food-additive. However, for decades, concerns have been raised about the issue of glutamate's safety as a food additive; especially, with regards to its ability (or otherwise) to cross the blood-brain barrier, cause excitotoxicity, or lead to neuron death. Results of animal studies following glutamate administration via different routes suggest that an array of effects can be observed. While some of the changes appear deleterious, some are not fully-understood, and the impact of others might even be beneficial. These observations suggest that with regards to the mammalian brain, exogenous glutamate might exert a double-sided effect, and in essence be a two-faced molecule whose effects may be dependent on several factors. This review draws from the research experiences of the authors and other researchers regarding the effects of exogenous glutamate on the brain of rodents. We also highlight the possible implications of such effects on the brain, in health and disease. Finally, we deduce that beyond the culinary effects of exogenous glutamate, there is the possibility of a beneficial role in the understanding and management of brain disorders.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",NeuroToxicology,Sep-20

Case reports of juvenile HD (onset <= 20 years) describe heterogeneous motoric and non-motoric symptoms, often accompanied with a delay in diagnosis. We aimed to describe this rare group of patients, especially with regard to socio-medical aspects and individual or common treatment strategies. In addition, we differentiated between juvenile and the recently defined pediatric HD population (onset < 18 years). Method(s): Out of 2593 individual HD patients treated within the last 25 years in the Huntington Centre, North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), 32 subjects were analyzed with an early onset younger than 21 years (1.23%, juvenile) and 18 of them younger than 18 years of age (0.69%, pediatric). Result(s): Beside a high degree of school problems, irritability or aggressive behavior (62.5% of pediatric and 31.2% of juvenile cases), serious problems concerning the social and family background were reported in 25% of the pediatric cohort. This includes an attempted rape and robbery at the age of 12, as problems caused by the affected children, but also alcohol-dependency in a two-year-old induced by a non-HD affected stepfather. A high degree of suicidal attempts and ideations (31.2% in pediatric and 33.3% in juvenile group) was reported, including drinking of solvents, swallowing razor blades or jumping from the fifth floor with following incomplete paraparesis. Beside dopaminergic drugs for treatment of bradykinesia, benzodiazepines and tetrabenazine for treatment of dystonia, cannabinoids, botulinum toxin injection and deep brain stimulation were used for the improvement of movement disorders, clozapine for the treatment of tremor, and dopa-induced hallucinations and zuclopenthixole for the treatment of severe aggressive behavior. Conclusion(s): Beside abnormalities in behavior from an early age due to HD pathology, children seem to have higher socio-medical problems related to additional burden caused by early affected parents, instable family backgrounds including drug abuse of a parent or multiple changes of partners. Treatment required individualized strategies in many cases.Copyright © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Brain Sciences,Jun-20

transcranial magnetic stimulation","The U.S. is currently facing an unprecedented epidemic of opioid-related deaths. Despite the efficacy of the current treatments for opioid use disorder (OUD), including psychosocial interventions and medication-assisted therapy (MAT), many patients remain treatment-resistant and at high risk for overdose. A potential augmentation strategy includes the use of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and auricular vagus nerve stimulation (aVNS). These approaches may have therapeutic benefits by directly or indirectly modulating the neurocircuitry affected in OUD. In this review, we evaluate the available studies on NIBS in the context of OUD withdrawal and detoxification, maintenance, and cravings, while also considering analgesia and safety concerns. In the context of opioid withdrawal and detoxification, a percutaneous form of aVNS has positive results in open-label trials, but has not yet been tested against sham. No randomized studies have reported on the safety and efficacy of NIBS specifically for maintenance treatment in OUD. TMS and tDCS have demonstrated effects on cravings, although published studies were limited by small sample sizes. NIBS may play a role in reducing exposure to opioids and the risk of developing OUD, as demonstrated by studies using tDCS in an experimental pain condition and TMS in a post-operative setting. Overall, while the preliminary evidence and safety for NIBS in the prevention and treatment of OUD appears promising, further research is needed with larger sample sizes, placebo control, and objective biomarkers as outcome measures before strong conclusions can be drawn.Copyright © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Journal of Addictive Diseases,17-Feb-20

withdrawal syndrome","Several psychoactive drugs can evoke substance use disorders (SUD) in humans and animals, and these include psychostimulants, opioids, cannabinoids (CB), nicotine, and alcohol. The etiology, mechanistic processes, and the therapeutic options to deal with SUD are not well understood. The common feature of all abused drugs is that they increase dopamine (DA) neurotransmission within the mesocorticolimbic circuitry of the brain followed by the activation of DA receptors. D2 receptors were proposed as important molecular targets for SUD. The findings showed that D2 receptors formed heteromeric complexes with other GPCRs, which forced the addiction research area in new directions. In this review, we updated the view on the brain D2 receptor complexes with adenosine (A)2A receptors (A2AR) and discussed the role of A2AR in different aspects of addiction phenotypes in laboratory animal procedures that permit the highly complex syndrome of human drug addiction. We presented the current knowledge on the neurochemical in vivo and ex vivo mechanisms related to cocaine use disorder (CUD) and discussed future research directions for A2AR heteromeric complexes in SUD.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

Review

serotoninergic system","Alcohol addiction is one of the highly prevalent neurological disorders and a major threat to public health in the 21st century. Alcohol addiction affects people from all age groups and often leads to other serious comorbidities. The pathophysiology of alcohol addiction involves imbalance between the excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters in the brain. These changes occur in various regions of the brain including reward circuit such as the ventral tegmental area (VTA), nucleus accumbens (NAc), and prefrontal cortex. In this review, we have discussed several neurochemical circuitries which get manipulated and maladapted during alcohol addiction. To date there is no effective therapeutic intervention in clinics devoid of side effects that can successfully treat the patients suffering from alcohol addiction. Understanding the neurobiological intricacies of alcohol addiction is critical for the development of novel anti-addiction therapeutics. Apart from this, we have also discussed the recent therapeutic milestones for the management of alcohol addiction including vasopressin receptors, corticotrophin-releasing factor, GABA receptors, glucocorticoid receptors, brain stimulation and mindfulness-oriented recovery enhancement.Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.",ACS Chemical Neuroscience,06-May-20

vulnerable population","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has broadly disrupted biomedical treatment and research including non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS). Moreover, the rapid onset of societal disruption and evolving regulatory restrictions may not have allowed for systematic planning of how clinical and research work may continue throughout the pandemic or be restarted as restrictions are abated. The urgency to provide and develop NIBS as an intervention for diverse neurological and mental health indications, and as a catalyst of fundamental brain research, is not dampened by the parallel efforts to address the most life-threatening aspects of COVID-19; rather in many cases the need for NIBS is heightened including the potential to mitigate mental health consequences related to COVID-19. Objective(s): To facilitate the re-establishment of access to NIBS clinical services and research operations during the current COVID-19 pandemic and possible future outbreaks, we develop and discuss a framework for balancing the importance of NIBS operations with safety considerations, while addressing the needs of all stakeholders. We focus on Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and low intensity transcranial Electrical Stimulation (tES) - including transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS). Method(s): The present consensus paper provides guidelines and good practices for managing and reopening NIBS clinics and laboratories through the immediate and ongoing stages of COVID-19. The document reflects the analysis of experts with domain-relevant expertise spanning NIBS technology, clinical services, and basic and clinical research - with an international perspective. We outline regulatory aspects, human resources, NIBS optimization, as well as accommodations for specific demographics. Result(s): A model based on three phases (early COVID-19 impact, current practices, and future preparation) with an 11-step checklist (spanning removing or streamlining in-person protocols, incorporating telemedicine, and addressing COVID-19-associated adverse events) is proposed. Recommendations on implementing social distancing and sterilization of NIBS related equipment, specific considerations of COVID-19 positive populations including mental health comorbidities, as well as considerations regarding regulatory and human resource in the era of COVID-19 are outlined. We discuss COVID-19 considerations specifically for clinical (sub-)populations including pediatric, stroke, addiction, and the elderly. Numerous case-examples across the world are described. Conclusion(s): There is an evident, and in cases urgent, need to maintain NIBS operations through the COVID-19 pandemic, including anticipating future pandemic waves and addressing effects of COVID-19 on brain and mind. The proposed robust and structured strategy aims to address the current and anticipated future challenges while maintaining scientific rigor and managing risk.Copyright © 2020 The Authors",Brain Stimulation,July - August 2020

Review

ventral tegmentum","The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been classically defined as the brain region responsible for higher cognitive functions, including the decision-making process. Ample information has been gathered during the last 40 years in an attempt to understand how it works. We now know extensively about the connectivity of this region and its relationship with neuromodulatory ascending projection areas, such as the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) or the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Both areas are well-known regulators of the reward-based decision-making process and hence likely to be involved in processes like evidence integration, impulsivity or addiction biology, but also in helping us to predict the valence of our future actions: i.e., what is ""good"" and what is ""bad."" Here we propose a hypothesis of a critical period, during which the inputs of the mPFC compete for target innervation, establishing specific prefrontal network configurations in the adult brain. We discuss how these different prefrontal configurations are linked to brain diseases such as addiction or neuropsychiatric disorders, and especially how drug abuse and other events during early life stages might lead to the formation of more vulnerable prefrontal network configurations. Finally, we show different promising pharmacological approaches that, when combined with the appropriate stimuli, will be able to re-establish these functional prefrontocortical configurations during adulthood.© Copyright © 2020 Guirado, Perez-Rando, Ferragud, Gutierrez-Castellanos, Umemori, Carceller, Nacher and Castillo-Gomez.",Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience,07-Apr-20

upregulation","Cocaine use disorder and methamphetamine use disorder are chronic, relapsing disorders with no US Food and Drug Administration-approved interventions. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation tool that has been increasingly investigated as a possible therapeutic intervention for substance use disorders. rTMS may have the ability to induce beneficial neuroplasticity in abnormal circuits and networks in individuals with addiction. The aim of this review is to highlight the rationale and potential for rTMS to treat cocaine and methamphetamine dependence: we synthesize the outcomes of studies in healthy humans and animal models to identify and understand the neurobiological mechanisms of rTMS that seem most involved in addiction, focusing on the dopaminergic and glutamatergic systems. rTMS-induced changes to neurotransmitter systems include alterations to striatal dopamine release and metabolite levels, as well as to glutamate transporter and receptor expression, which may be relevant for ameliorating the aberrant plasticity observed in individuals with substance use disorders. We also discuss the clinical studies that have used rTMS in humans with cocaine and methamphetamine use disorders. Many such studies suggest changes in network connectivity following acute rTMS, which may underpin reduced craving following chronic rTMS. We suggest several possible future directions for research relating to the therapeutic potential of rTMS in addiction that would help fill current gaps in the literature. Such research would apply rTMS to animal models of addiction, developing a translational pipeline that would guide evidence-based rTMS treatment of cocaine and methamphetamine use disorder.© Copyright © 2020 Moretti, Poh and Rodger.",Frontiers in Neuroscience,06-Mar-20

transcranial magnetic stimulation","Background: Alcohol dependence (AD) is characterized by a set of physical and behavioral symptoms, which may include withdrawal, tolerance and craving. Recently, noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) methods, namely transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), have been investigated as possible new therapeutic approaches for adjusting the pathological neuroplasticity involved in alcohol dependence. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the therapeutic uses of tDCS and rTMS in AD patients. Method(s): A systematic search was performed on Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane library and ProQuest. Search terms presented the diagnoses of interest (alcohol dependence, alcohol craving, alcohol use disorders and hazardous drinkers) and the intervention of interest (NIBS, TMS, rTMS, TBS, tDCS, tACS and transcranial). Original articles reporting the use of tDCS or rTMS to treat AD were screened and studied by two researchers independently based on PRISMA guidelines. Next, in the meta-analysis step, random-effects model was utilized to measure the pooled effect size. Result(s): We found 34 eligible studies including 11 tDCS trials and 23 rTMS trials. Three of these studies were case-reports, four were open label trials and the remaining 27 were controlled trials which assessed tDCS/rTMS effects on the three cognitive, behavioral and biological dimensions in AD. The pooled standardized mean differences for the effects of tDCS and rTMS on alcohol cravings were - 0.13 [-0.34, 0.08] and - 0.43 [-1.02, 0.17], respectively. Conclusion(s): There is no evidence for a positive effect of tDCS/rTMS on various dimensions of AD. We need more randomized, double blind, sham controlled trials with enough follow-up periods to evaluate the efficacy of tDCS/rTMS for alcohol dependence treatment.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry,13-Jul-20

Disruptions of the normal oscillatory brain activities are commonly observed in neurological and psychiatric disorders including epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, anxiety/trauma-related disorders, major depressive disorders, and drug addiction. Therefore, these disorders can be considered as common oscillation defects despite having distinct behavioral manifestations and genetic causes. Recent technical advances of neuronal activity recording and analysis have allowed us to study the pathological oscillations of each disorder as a possible biomarker of symptoms. Furthermore, recent advances in brain stimulation technologies enable time- and space-targeted interventions of the pathological oscillations of both neurological disorders and psychiatric disorders as possible targets for regulating their symptoms.Copyright © 2020",Neuroscience Research,Mar-20

working memory","Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a promising treatment for many memory-related disorders including dementia, anxiety, and addiction. However, the use of DBS can be a paradoxical conundrum-dementia treatments aim to improve memory, whereas anxiety or addiction treatments aim to suppress maladaptive memory. In this review, the key hypotheses on how DBS affects memory are highlighted. We consolidate the findings and conclusions from the current research on the effects of DBS on memory in attempt to make sense of the bidirectional nature of DBS in disrupting and enhancing memory. Based on the current literature, we hypothesize that the timing of DBS plays a key role in its contradictory effects, and therefore, we propose a consolidated model of how DBS can both disrupt and enhance memory.Copyright: © 2019 Tan SZK et al.

transcranial magnetic stimulation","Alcohol use disorders remain one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity across the world, yet despite this impact, there are few treatment options for patients suffering from these disorders. To this end, non-invasive brain stimulation, most commonly utilizing technologies including transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), has recently emerged as promising potential treatments for alcohol use disorders. Enthusiasm for these interventions is fueled by their non-invasive nature, generally favorable safety profile, and ability to target and modulate brain regions implicated in substance use disorders. In this paper, we describe the underlying principles behind these commonly used stimulation technologies, summarize existing experiments and randomized controlled trials, and provide an integrative summary with suggestions for future areas of research. Currently available data generally supports the use of non-invasive brain stimulation as a near-term treatment for alcohol use disorder, with important caveats regarding the use of stimulation in this patient population.Copyright © 2019, This is a U.S. government work and its text is not subject to copyright protection in the United States; however, its text may be subject to foreign copyright protection.",Neurotherapeutics,01-Jan-20

Review","Environmental contexts that are reliably associated with the use of pharmacologically active substances are hypothesized to contribute to substance use disorders. In this review, we provide an updated summary of parallel preclinical and human studies that support this hypothesis. Research conducted in rats shows that environmental contexts that are reliably paired with drug use can renew extinguished drug-seeking behavior and amplify responding elicited by discrete, drug-predictive cues. Akin to drug-associated contexts, interoceptive drug stimuli produced by the psychopharmacological effects of drugs can also influence learning and memory processes that play a role in substance use disorders. Findings from human laboratory studies show that drug-associated contexts, including social stimuli, can have profound effects on cue reactivity, drug use, and drug-related cognitive expectancies. This translationally relevant research supports the idea that treatments for substance use disorders could be improved by considering drug-associated contexts as a factor in treatment interventions. We conclude this review with ideas for how to integrate drug-associated contexts into treatment-oriented research based on 4 approaches: pharmacology, brain stimulation, mindfulness-based relapse prevention, and cognitive behavioral group therapy. Throughout, we focus on alcohol- and tobacco-related research, which are two of the most prevalent and commonly misused drugs worldwide for which there are known treatments.Copyright © 2020, The American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics, Inc.",Neurotherapeutics,01-Jan-20

Over the past two decades, several clinical trials with multiple years of follow-up have shown that DBS offers long-term symptom relief for individuals with severe OCD, though a portion of patients do not achieve an adequate response. Areas covered: This review sought to summarize the literature on the efficacy and long-term effectiveness of DBS for OCD, and to identify strategies that have the potential to improve treatment outcomes. Expert opinion: Although this literature is just emerging, a small number of DBS enhancement strategies have shown promising initial results. More posterior targets along the striatal axis and at the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis appear to offer greater symptom relief than more anterior targets. Research is also beginning to demonstrate the feasibility of maximizing treatment outcomes with target selection based on neural activation patterns during symptom provocation and clinical presentation. Finally, integrating DBS with post-surgery exposure and response prevention therapy appears to be another promising approach. Definitive conclusions about these strategies are limited by a low number of studies with small sample sizes that will require multi-site replication.Copyright © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Expert Review of Neurotherapeutics,02-Jan-20

Studies of DBS post-operative outcomes are often restricted to data from a single center and consider DBS in isolation. National estimates of DBS readmission and post-operative outcomes are needed, as are comparisons to commonly performed surgeries. Method(s): This study used datasets from the 2013 and 2014 Nationwide Readmissions Database (NRD). Our sample was restricted to PD patients discharged alive after hospitalization for DBS surgery. Descriptive analyses examined patient, clinical, hospital and index hospitalization characteristics. The all-cause, non-elective 30-day readmission rate after DBS was calculated, and logistic regression models were built to examine factors associated with readmission. Readmission rates for the most common surgical procedures were calculated and compared to DBS. Result(s): There were 6058 DBS surgeries for PD in our sample, most often involving a male aged 65 and older, who lived in a high socioeconomic status zip code. DBS patients had an average of four comorbidities. With respect to outcomes, the majority of patients were discharged home (95.3%). Non-elective readmission was rare (4.9%), and was associated with socioeconomic status, comorbidity burden, and teaching hospital status. Much higher acute, non-elective readmission rates were observed for common procedures such as upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (16.2%), colonoscopy (14.0%), and cardiac defibrillator and pacemaker procedures (11.1%). Conclusion(s): Short-term hospitalization outcomes after DBS are generally favorable. Socioeconomic disparities in DBS use persist. Additional efforts may be needed to improve provider referrals for and patient access to DBS.Copyright © 2019",Parkinsonism and Related Disorders,Jan-20

However, the underlying cognitive processes of risk-seeking behaviours observed in chronic cocaine users (CU) have so far remained unclear. Here we therefore tested whether CU differ from stimulant-naive controls in their sensitivity to gain, loss, and probability of loss information when making decisions under risk. Method(s): A sample of 96 participants (56 CU and 40 controls) performed the no-feedback version of the Columbia Card Task, designed to assess risk-taking in relation to gain, loss, and probability of loss information. Additionally, cognitive performance and impulsivity were determined. Current and recent substance use was objectively assessed by toxicological urine and hair analysis. Result(s): Compared to controls, CU showed increased risk-seeking in unfavourable decision scenarios in which the loss probability was high and the returns were low, and a tendency for increased risk aversion in more favourable decision scenarios. In comparison to controls, CU were less sensitive to gain, but similarly sensitive to loss and probability of loss information. Further analysis revealed that individual differences in sensitivity to loss and probability of loss information were related to cognitive performance and impulsivity. Conclusion(s): Reduced sensitivity to gains in people with CU may contribute to their propensity for making risky decisions. While these alterations in gain sensitivity might directly relate to cocaine use per se, the individual psychopathological profile of CU might moderate sensitivity to loss information.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Behavioural Brain Research,03-Feb-20

Drinks sweetened with both sugar and artificial additives lead to dopamine release at the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in rat models; the basis of experiences of pleasure in humans, resulting in impulsive binging behaviour at times. 2. Evidence from rat models show cross sensitisation between sweetened drinks, alcohol, opiates and stimulants. Therefore, it could be hypothesised that sweetened drinks could be a gateway to multiple substance abuse among humans via 'alcopops'. 3. Identification of an allelic variant of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate responsive element modulator gene (CREM), linking impulsivity and multiple substance abuse, opens up prospects of mass screening to advice on harm reduction. 4. Furthermore, therapies involving cannabinoid receptor antagonists and transcranial brain stimulation are being currently investigated; of benefit to limit binge use of sweetened drinks.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Medical Hypotheses,Feb-20

thalamus","The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a subcortical brain structure known primarily for its roles in pleasure, reward, and addiction. Despite less focus on the NAc in pain research, it also plays a large role in the mediation of pain and is effective as a source of analgesia. Evidence for this involvement lies in the NAc's cortical connections, functions, pharmacology, and therapeutic targeting. The NAc projects to and receives information from notable pain structures, such as the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, periaqueductal gray, habenula, thalamus, etc. Additionally, the NAc and other pain-modulating structures share functions involving opioid regulation and motivational and emotional processing, which each work beyond simply the rewarding experience of pain offset. Pharmacologically speaking, the NAc responds heavily to painful stimuli, due to its high density of mu opioid receptors and the activation of several different neurotransmitter systems in the NAc, such as opioids, dopamine, calcitonin gene-related peptide, gamma-aminobutyric acid, glutamate, and substance P, each of which have been shown to elicit analgesic effects. In both preclinical and clinical models, deep brain stimulation of the NAc has elicited successful analgesia. The multi-functional NAc is important in motivational behavior, and the motivation for avoiding pain is just as important to survival as the motivation for seeking pleasure. It is possible, then, that the NAc must be involved in both pleasure and pain in order to help determine the motivational salience of positive and negative events.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.

However, the outcomes of such treatments appear to be somewhat paradoxical, in that these techniques can both disrupt and enhance memory even when applied to the same brain target. In this article, we hypothesize that disruption and enhancement of memory through neuromodulation can be explained by the dropout of engram nodes. We used a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits and letters and applied dropout at different stages to simulate DBS effects on engrams. We showed that dropout applied during training improved the accuracy of prediction, whereas dropout applied during testing dramatically decreased the accuracy of prediction, which mimics enhancement and disruption of memory, respectively. We further showed that transfer learning of neural networks with dropout had increased the accuracy and rate of learning. Dropout during training provided a more robust ""skeleton"" network and, together with transfer learning, mimicked the effects of chronic DBS on memory. Overall, we showed that the dropout of engram nodes is a possible mechanism by which neuromodulation techniques such as DBS can both disrupt and enhance memory, providing a unique perspective on this paradox.© Copyright © 2020 Tan, Du, Perucho, Chopra, Vardhanabhuti and Lim.",Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience,14-Sep-20

The choice of the target may vary based on the form of addiction: NAcc in alcohol and opiate addiction and STN in cocaine addict patients.

The present article critically examines these implications derived from the food addiction concept. Recent Findings: Introducing food addiction as a new disorder in diagnostic classification system seems redundant as most individuals with an addiction-like eating behavior are already covered by established eating disorder diagnoses. Food addiction may be a useful metaphor in the treatment of binge eating, but would be inappropriate for the majority of obese individuals. Implying an addiction to certain foods is not necessary when applying certain approaches inspired by the addiction field for prevention and treatment of obesity. The usefulness of abstinence models in the treatment of eating disorders and obesity needs to be rigorously tested in future studies. Summary: Some practical implications derived from the food addiction concept provide promising avenues for future research (e.g., using an addiction framework in the treatment of binge eating or applying abstinence models). For others, however, the necessity of implying an addiction to some foods needs to be scrutinized.Copyright © 2019, The Author(s).",Current Obesity Reports,15-Mar-19

In subjects with substance use disorder, PIT is even enhanced with functional activation in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and amygdala. While we observed enhanced behavioral and neural PIT effects in alcohol-dependent subjects, we here aimed to determine whether behavioral PIT is enhanced in young men with high-risk compared to low-risk drinking and subsequently related functional activation in an a-priori region of interest encompassing the NAcc and amygdala and related to polygenic risk for alcohol consumption. A representative sample of 18-year old men (n = 1937) was contacted: 445 were screened, 209 assessed: resulting in 191 valid behavioral, 139 imaging and 157 genetic datasets. None of the subjects fulfilled criteria for alcohol dependence according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV-TextRevision (DSM-IV-TR). We measured how instrumental responding for rewards was influenced by background Pavlovian conditioned stimuli predicting action-independent rewards and losses. Behavioral PIT was enhanced in high-compared to low-risk drinkers (b = 0.09, SE = 0.03, z = 2.7, p < 0.009). Across all subjects, we observed PIT-related neural blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal in the right amygdala (t = 3.25, pSVC = 0.04, x = 26, y = -6, z = -12), but not in NAcc. The strength of the behavioral PIT effect was positively correlated with polygenic risk for alcohol consumption (rs = 0.17, p = 0.032). We conclude that behavioral PIT and polygenic risk for alcohol consumption might be a biomarker for a subclinical phenotype of risky alcohol consumption, even if no drug-related stimulus is present. The association between behavioral PIT effects and the amygdala might point to habitual processes related to out PIT task. In non-dependent young social drinkers, the amygdala rather than the NAcc is activated during PIT; possible different involvement in association with disease trajectory should be investigated in future studies.Copyright © 2019 by the authors.

vaccination","Nanotechnology has the potential to open many novel diagnostic and treatment avenues for disorders of the central nervous system (CNS). In this review, we discuss recent developments in the applications of nanotechnology in CNS therapies, diagnosis and biology. Novel approaches for the diagnosis and treatment of neuroinflammation, brain dysfunction, psychiatric conditions, brain cancer, and nerve injury provide insights into the potential of nanomedicine. We also highlight nanotechnology-enabled neuroscience techniques such as electrophysiology and intracellular sampling to improve our understanding of the brain and its components. With nanotechnology integrally involved in the advancement of basic neuroscience and the development of novel treatments, combined diagnostic and therapeutic applications have begun to emerge. Nanotheranostics for the brain, able to achieve single-cell resolution, will hasten the rate in which we can diagnose, monitor, and treat diseases. Taken together, the recent advances highlighted in this review demonstrate the prospect for significant improvements to clinical diagnosis and treatment of a vast array of neurological diseases. However, it is apparent that a strong dialogue between the nanoscience and neuroscience communities will be critical for the development of successful nanotherapeutics that move to the clinic, benefit patients, and address unmet needs in CNS disorders.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews,Aug-19

Neuromodulation may provide a new type of treatment for addiction since it can directly target abnormalities in neurocircuits. We review literature on five neuromodulation techniques investigated for efficacy in substance related and behavioral addictions: transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), (repetitive) transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), EEG, fMRI neurofeedback and deep brain stimulation (DBS) and additionally report on effects of these interventions on addiction-related cognitive processes. While rTMS and tDCS, mostly applied at the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, show reductions in immediate craving for various addictive substances, placebo-responses are high and long-term outcomes are understudied. The lack in well-designed EEG-neurofeedback studies despite decades of investigation impedes conclusions about its efficacy. Studies investigating fMRI neurofeedback are new and show initial promising effects on craving, but future trials are needed to investigate long-term and behavioral effects. Case studies report prolonged abstinence of opioids or alcohol with ventral striatal DBS but difficulties with patient inclusion may hinder larger, controlled trials. DBS in neuropsychiatric patients modulates brain circuits involved in reward processing, extinction and negative-reinforcement that are also relevant for addiction. To establish the potential of neuromodulation for addiction, more randomized controlled trials are needed that also investigate treatment duration required for long-term abstinence and potential synergy with other addiction interventions. Finally, future advancement may be expected from tailoring neuromodulation techniques to specific patient (neurocognitive) profiles.",Neuropsychology review,01-Mar-19

However, even approved treatments are subject to limited efficacy with high long-term relapse rates. Current treatment approaches are typically a combination of pharmacotherapies and behavioral counselling. Growing evidence and technological advances suggest the potential of brain stimulation techniques for the treatment of SUDs. There are three main brain stimulation techniques that are outlined in this review: transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and deep brain stimulation (DBS). The insula, a region of the cerebral cortex, is known to be involved in critical aspects underlying SUDs, such as interoception, decision making, anxiety, pain perception, cognition, mood, threat recognition, and conscious urges. This review focuses on both the preclinical and clinical evidence demonstrating the role of the insula in addiction, thereby demonstrating its promise as a target for brain stimulation. Future research should evaluate the optimal parameters for brain stimulation of the insula, through the use of relevant biomarkers and clinical outcomes for SUDs.© Copyright © 2019 Ibrahim, Rubin-Kahana, Pushparaj, Musiol, Blumberger, Daskalakis, Zangen and Le Foll.",Frontiers in Pharmacology,02-Jul-19

It is also characterized by a high mortality rate by suicide. Method(s): The published literature on repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), thetaburst stimulation (TBS), and deep TMS in the treatment of BPD were reviewed. Result(s): Four clinical studies (2 randomized trials and 2 case studies) with limited sample sizes found that TMS and TBS were safe and potentially effective in the reduction of symptoms of BPD. Conclusion(s): Given the limited clinical evidence for efficacy on the basis of the results of these studies, future controlled studies involving larger samples and optimal stimulus parameters should be designed to confirm the short-term and long-term safety and efficacy of repetitive TMS and TBS in the treatment of BPD.Copyright © 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.",Journal of Psychiatric Practice,Jan-19

substance use","Substance use disorder is a highly prevalent condition, leading to significant morbidity, mortality, and burden on the health care system. Substance use disorders are overrepresented among individuals with a mental illness. The term ""dual diagnosis"" was introduced by the World Health Organization in the mid-1990s and refers to the co-occurrence of a substance use disorder with mental illness-a more recently used term is ""co-occurring disorders."" In the past decade, substantial progress has been made toward expanding psychotherapeutic and pharmacotherapeutic treatments for treating co-occurring disorders. Yet management remains a challenge among clinicians and has been a source of confusion and considerable controversy. This review describes the epidemiology and treatment of co-occurring disorders, with a focus on major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Substance usemay make diagnosis of the underlying psychiatric condition difficult, and a period of abstinence may be necessary. Findings from efficacy studies of medications used to treat co-occurring disorders are reviewed, as are results of preliminary studies of newer treatments, such as topiramate, ketamine, noninvasive brain stimulation, and deep brain stimulation. Treatment recommendations that combine medications and psychosocial interventions are summarized.Copyright © 2019 Focus (United States). All rights reserved.",Focus (United States),2019

working memory","Although there is general consensus that altered brain structure and function underpins addictive disorders, clinicians working in addiction treatment rarely incorporate neuroscience-informed approaches into their practice. We recently launched the Neuroscience Interest Group within the International Society of Addiction Medicine (ISAM-NIG) to promote initiatives to bridge this gap. This article summarizes the ISAM-NIG key priorities and strategies to achieve implementation of addiction neuroscience knowledge and tools for the assessment and treatment of substance use disorders. We cover two assessment areas: cognitive assessment and neuroimaging, and two interventional areas: cognitive training/remediation and neuromodulation, where we identify key challenges and proposed solutions. We reason that incorporating cognitive assessment into clinical settings requires the identification of constructs that predict meaningful clinical outcomes. Other requirements are the development of measures that are easily-administered, reliable, and ecologically-valid. Translation of neuroimaging techniques requires the development of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and testing the cost-effectiveness of these biomarkers in individualized prediction algorithms for relapse prevention and treatment selection. Integration of cognitive assessments with neuroimaging can provide multilevel targets including neural, cognitive, and behavioral outcomes for neuroscience-informed interventions. Application of neuroscience-informed interventions including cognitive training/remediation and neuromodulation requires clear pathways to design treatments based on multilevel targets, additional evidence from randomized trials and subsequent clinical implementation, including evaluation of cost-effectiveness. We propose to address these challenges by promoting international collaboration between researchers and clinicians, developing harmonized protocols and data management systems, and prioritizing multi-site research that focuses on improving clinical outcomes.© Copyright © 2019 Verdejo-Garcia, Lorenzetti, Manning, Piercy, Bruno, Hester, Pennington, Tolomeo, Arunogiri, Bates, Bowden-Jones, Campanella, Daughters, Kouimtsidis, Lubman, Meyerhoff, Ralph, Rezapour, Tavakoli, Zare-Bidoky, Zilverstand, Steele, Moeller, Paulus, Baldacchino and Ekhtiari.",Frontiers in Psychiatry,23-Dec-19

working memory","Recent methamphetamine and opioid use epidemics are a major public health concern. Chronic stimulant and opioid use are characterized by significant psychosocial, physical and mental health costs, repeated relapse, and heightened risk of early death. Neuroimaging research highlights deficits in brain processes and circuitry that are linked to responsivity to drug cues over natural rewards as well as suboptimal goal-directed decision-making. Despite the need for interventions, little is known about (1) how the brain changes with prolonged abstinence or as a function of various treatments; and (2) how symptoms change as a result of neuromodulation. This review focuses on the question: What do we know about changes in brain function during recovery from opioids and stimulants such as methamphetamine and cocaine? We provide a detailed overview and critique of published research employing a wide array of neuroimaging methods - functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalography, event-related potentials, diffusion tensor imaging, and multiple brain stimulation technologies along with neurofeedback - to track or induce changes in drug craving, abstinence, and treatment success in stimulant and opioid users. Despite the surge of methamphetamine and opioid use in recent years, most of the research on neuroimaging techniques for recovery focuses on cocaine use. This review highlights two main findings: (1) interventions can lead to improvements in brain function, particularly in frontal regions implicated in goal-directed behavior and cognitive control, paired with reduced drug urges/craving; and (2) the targeting of striatal mechanisms implicated in drug reward may not be as cost-effective as prefrontal mechanisms, given that deep brain stimulation methods require surgery and months of intervention to produce effects. Overall, more studies are needed to replicate and confirm findings, particularly for individuals with opioid and methamphetamine use disorders.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s)",NeuroImage: Clinical,2019

Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale","Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) occurs in 2-3% of the general population. Due to its chronicity and high resistance to standard treatment, alternative clinical management based on neuroscientific findings has been sought. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a modern and dynamic approach in the treatment of OCD giving hope to patients who are resistant to current pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy based treatments. This paper presents two cases of patients diagnosed with refractory OCD who received DBS therapy with concurrent pharmacotherapy and cognitive behavioral psychotherapy (CBT). Both patients underwent a neurosurgical procedure to implant electrodes into the anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc). Before and after the start of the neurostimulation, patients underwent a clinical evaluation which consisted of a psychiatric examination and psychometric measurements (Y-BOCS, HAMA, HDRS, GAF, SOFAS). During the followup period, a blind attempt to switch off the neurostimulation was made. During the 6-month follow-up period, a significant reduction in the obsessive-compulsive, depressive and anxiety symptoms was achieved as well as an improvement in global patient functioning. The tolerance of DBS was found to be very good and no significant side effects were observed. The obtained results provide the basis for the implementation of this method in patients with OCD who are resistant to current treatment.Copyright © 2019 Polish Psychiatric Association.

It has proven to be efficacious and safe in the treatment of neurological disorders, mainly Parkinson's disease (PD), dystonia and essential tremor. DBS has very often contributed to successful treatment in cases that had proved resistant to all other methods of treatment. Nowadays treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is the main psychiatric indication for DBS. Many studies have focused on assessing the efficacy and safety of this method in different mental disorders, including depressive disorders, Alzheimer's disease, anorexia nervosa, Tourette syndrome, substance addiction or aggressive behaviors. Single cases of successful treatment in bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and post traumatic stress disorder have also emerged in recent years. In this review the current state of knowledge on the applicability of DBS in psychiatry is presented, based on the available systematic reviews, clinical trials and case studies, as well as on neurophysiological and neuroimaging data.Copyright © 2019 Polish Psychiatric Association.

The ventral capsule/ventral striatum and nucleus accumbens (NAc) region is a clinically approved target for deep brain stimulation for obsessive-compulsive disorder. Method(s): We performed a comprehensive literature review to define clinically relevant anatomy and connectivity of the ventral capsule/ventral striatum and NAc region to guide target selection for deep brain stimulation. Result(s): Architecturally and functionally, the NAc is divided into the core and the shell, with each area having different connections. The shell primarily receives limbic information, and the core typically receives information from the motor system. In general, afferents from the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala are excitatory. The dopaminergic projections to the NAc from the ventral tegmental area modulate the balance of these excitatory inputs. Several important inputs to the NAc converge at the junction of the internal capsule (IC) and the anterior commissure (AC): the ventral amygdalofugal pathways that run parallel to and underneath the AC, the precommissural fornical fibers that run anterior to the AC, axons from the ventral prefrontal cortex and medial orbitofrontal cortex that occupy the most ventral part of the IC and embedding within the NAc and AC, and the superolateral branch of the medial forebrain bundle located parallel to the anterior thalamic radiation in the IC. Conclusion(s): The caudal part of the NAc passing through the IC-AC junction may be an effective target for deep brain stimulation to improve behavioral symptoms associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder.Copyright © 2019",World Neurosurgery,Jun-19

High-frequency (HF) rTMS over the prefrontal cortex (PFC), in particular the left dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), might represent a save and innovative treatment tool for tobacco consumption and craving in nicotine-dependent otherwise healthy people. rTMS can be effective for this indication also in patients with schizophrenia, but the results are conflicting and sufficient evidence from large-scale trials is still lacking. Promising results have been obtained using particular techniques for brain stimulation, such as deep rTMS and theta burst stimulation. Multiple-target HF rTMS can also have a potential in smoking cessation. fMRI and EEG recordings have proven to be useful for objectively assessing the treatment effects. TMS is likely to be most effective when paired with an evidence-based self-help intervention, cognitive-behavioral interventions and nicotine replacement therapy. However, the most recent studies employed different protocols and yielded heterogeneous results, which should be replicated in further controlled studies with larger sample sizes and rigorous standards of randomization. To date, no recommendation other than that a possible efficacy of HF-rTMS of the left DLPFC can be made for alternative rTMS procedures in nicotine craving and consumption.Copyright © 2019",Psychiatry Research,Nov-19

Although it has primarily been used to treat movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, and dystonia, recently it has been approved to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder and epilepsy. Novel potential indications in both neurological and psychiatric disorders are undergoing active study. There have been significant advances in DBS technology, including preoperative and intraoperative imaging, surgical approaches and techniques, and device improvements. In addition to providing significant clinical benefits and improving quality of life, DBS has also increased the understanding of human electrophysiology and network interactions. Despite the value of DBS, future developments should be aimed at developing less invasive techniques and attaining not just symptom improvement but curative disease modification.Copyright ©AANS 2019.",Journal of Neurosurgery,2019

Review","Behavioral sensitization to repeated psychostimulant administration has been proposed to reflect many of the neurochemical and behavioral changes that are characteristic of a range of disorders, including drug addiction and psychoses. While previous studies have examined the role of dopamine and glutamate neurotransmission in mediating sensitization, particularly within the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the role of inhibitory GABAergic processing of the PFC in the expression of sensitization is not well understood. Recent research, however, has proposed an emerging role of GABA synthesis, reuptake, ionotropic and metabotropic receptor regulation, and interneuronal changes following sensitization to methamphetamine and/or amphetamine within the PFC. The aim of this review, therefore, is to synthesize research findings on changes to the GABAergic network following sensitization induced by amphetamines (i.e., amphetamine and/or methamphetamine) in the PFC. In addition to providing an overview of global PFC changes, we also provide evidence of regional specific inhibitory influences on sensitized circuitry, focusing on the prelimbic and orbitofrontal cortices. We propose a neural circuit through which inhibitory PFC GABA changes mediate sensitized disease states, focusing on the interaction between the prelimbic and orbitofrontal cortices with subcortical brain structures and the mesolimbic system. Methodological considerations and avenues for future research are also discussed.Copyright © 2019",Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry,20-Dec-19

Three mechanisms (i.e. behavioral economic demand [consumption-price relationships], delay discounting [reinforcer devaluation with delay], and proportionate alcohol-related reinforcement [relative reinforcement attributable to alcohol]) are proposed to contribute to problematic alcohol use. Limited research has evaluated the unique contribution of these mechanisms for predicting future alcohol consumption. Aim(s): The purpose of this study was to evaluate the predictive relationship between these mechanisms and self-reported alcohol use frequency, quantity, and severity. Method(s): Participants (n=223) sampled from the crowdsourcing website Amazon Mechanical Turk completed a survey containing behavioral economic measures. Weekly reports of daily alcohol use were then collected for 18 weeks. Unadjusted and adjusted models determined the association between behavioral economic variables and alcohol use. Results/outcomes: Behavioral economic measures were associated with alcohol and soda use at baseline in a stimulus-selective manner (e.g. alcohol demand associated with alcohol, but not soda, variables). Predictive models adjusted for Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test scores indicated that increased proportionate alcohol-related reinforcement and behavioral economic demand were uniquely and incrementally associated with frequency (e.g. adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=5.54 for proportionate alcohol-related reinforcement, p<0.05) and quantity-severity measures (e.g. AOR=7.58 for alcohol demand intensity, p<0.001), respectively. Test-retest reliability was generally acceptable (rxx=0.42-0.76) with the exception of proportionate alcohol-related reinforcement (rxx=0.29). Conclusion/interpretation: These findings indicate the unique, predictive, and incremental validity of behavioral economic measures for evaluating future alcohol consumption, supporting their continued use in addiction science research.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.",Journal of Psychopharmacology,01-Jul-19

treatment response","Concurrent transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) has emerged as a powerful tool to non-invasively probe brain circuits in humans, allowing for the assessment of several cortical properties such as excitability and connectivity. Over the past decade, this technique has been applied to various clinical populations, enabling the characterization and development of potential TMS-EEG predictors and markers of treatments and of the pathophysiology of brain disorders. The objective of this article is to present a comprehensive review of studies that have used TMS-EEG in clinical populations and to discuss potential clinical applications. To provide a technical and theoretical framework, we first give an overview of TMS-EEG methodology and discuss the current state of knowledge regarding the use of TMS-EEG to assess excitability, inhibition, plasticity and connectivity following neuromodulatory techniques in the healthy brain. We then review the insights afforded by TMS-EEG into the pathophysiology and predictors of treatment response in psychiatric and neurological conditions, before presenting recommendations for how to address some of the salient challenges faced in clinical TMS-EEG research. Finally, we conclude by presenting future directions in line with the tremendous potential of TMS-EEG as a clinical tool.Copyright © 2019 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology",Clinical Neurophysiology,May-19

In recent years, deep brain stimulation (DBS) has increasingly been used for the treatment of addiction. Case Description: This study reports on 2 MA-dependent patients who received DBS of the nucleus accumbens (NAc). During the approximately 2-year follow-up period, one patient (A) remained abstinent and presented with positive emotional experiences, whereas the other (B) had no significant psychobehavioral changes during stimulation at low-to-moderate voltages and subsequently relapsed. Through coregistration of preoperative magnetic resonance imaging with postoperative computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging, the DBS electrode of patient A was confirmed to be accurately implanted in the NAc, whereas one side of the electrode of patient B deviated from the target. Conclusion(s): These case reports demonstrate that NAc-DBS maybe a possible treatment option for MA addiction.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",World Neurosurgery,Feb-19

In ICSS procedures, subjects with microelectrodes implanted into a brain-reward region are trained to press an operant response lever for pulses of electrical brain stimulation, and drugs are evaluated for their effectiveness to increase or ""facilitate"" ICSS responding (an abuse-related effect) or to depress ICSS responding (an abuse-limiting effect). ICSS has been used for decades to evaluate determinants of opioid abuse potential, and this article reviews pharmacological and biological determinants of opioid abuse potential as revealed by ICSS studies in rodents. One of the most important observations from ICSS studies is that abused mu opioid receptor (MOR) agonists like morphine often fail to produce abuse-related ICSS facilitation in opioid-naive subjects, but several days of repeated opioid exposure is sufficient for opioid-induced facilitation to emerge. Future studies with ICSS could help (a) to clarify mechanisms that increase MOR agonist abuse potential during early opioid exposure or during chronic exposure leading to dependence, (b) to evaluate novel opioids either developed as candidate analgesics with reduced abuse potential or identified as designer opioids being synthesized and distributed for illicit use, and (c) to test candidate pharmacotherapies for treatment of opioid abuse in non-dependent and dependent subjects.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Peptides,Feb-19

Moreover, attentional bias for alcohol-related cues varies between problem and non-problem drinkers. Aim(s): To examine attentional bias towards alcoholic and non-alcoholic appetitive cues between problem and non-problem drinkers. Method(s): Forty-one university students (9 male, 32 female; Mage = 21.50) completed an eye-tracking gaze contingency paradigm, measuring the number of times participants looked at peripherally and centrally located stimuli (break frequency) when instructed to maintain focus on a target object. Stimuli consisted of appetitive alcohol-related (e.g., wine), appetitive non-alcohol-related (e.g., cola) and non-appetitive (e.g., fabric softener) stimuli. Participants were split using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) into non-problem (M AUDIT = 3.86) and problematic drinkers (M AUDIT = 11.59). Result(s): Problematic drinkers had higher break frequencies towards peripheral appetitive stimuli than towards non-appetitive stimuli, while break frequency was equivalent between appetitive cues presented centrally (alcohol and non-alcohol-related). In contrast, there were no differences in break frequency across stimuli type or cue presentation location (central or peripheral) for non-problem drinkers. Conclusion(s): In contrast to non-problem drinkers, people displaying more problematic consumption practices may find it more difficult to inhibit eye movements towards appetitive stimuli, particularly when in peripheral vision. This may suggest that attentional biases, as measured in terms of overt eye movements, in problem drinkers may be most powerful when the alcoholic and appetitive stimuli are not directly in field of view. An uncertainty reduction process in the allocation of attention to appetitive cues may help explain the patterns of results observed.Copyright © 2018",Addictive Behaviors,Mar-19

Many health disorders in male patients affect sexual activity by directly causing erectile dysfunction, affecting sexual motivation, or both. Clinical evidence indicates that many diseases strongly disrupt sexual motivation and sexual performance in patients with depression, addiction, diabetes mellitus and other metabolic disturbances with obesity and diet-related factors, kidney and liver failure, circadian rhythm disorders, sleep disturbances including obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, developmental and hormonal disorders, brain damages, cardiovascular diseases, and peripheral neuropathies. Preclinical studies of these conditions often require appropriate experimental paradigms, including animal models. Male sexual behavior and motivation have been intensively investigated over the last 80 years in animal rat model. Sexual motivation can be examined using such parameters as: anticipatory behavior and 50-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations reflecting the emotional state of rats, initiation of copulation, efficiency of copulation, or techniques of classical (pavlovian) and instrumental conditioning. In this review article, we analyze the behavioral parameters that describe the sexual motivation and sexual performance of male rats in the context of animal experimental models of human health disorders. Based on analysis of the parameters describing the heterogeneous and complex structure of sexual behavior in laboratory rodents, we propose an approach that is useful for delineating distinct mechanisms affecting sexual motivation and sexual performance in selected disease states and the efficacy of therapy in preclinical investigations.© Copyright © 2019 Bialy, Bogacki-Rychlik, Przybylski and Zera.",Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience,26-Nov-19

To view the insula-claustrum region from the molecular perspective we analyzed the transcriptomic profile of these areas in six adult and four fetal human brains. We identified marker genes with specific expression and performed transcriptome-wide tests for enrichment of biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components. In addition, specific insular and claustral expression of genes pertaining to diseases, addiction, and depression was tested. At the anatomical level, we used brain-wide analyses to determine the specificity of our results and to determine the transcriptomic similarity of the insula-claustrum region. We found UCMA to be the most significantly enriched gene in the insular cortex and confirmed specific expression of NR4A2, NTNG2, and LXN in the claustrum. Furthermore, the insula was found to have enriched expression of genes associated with mood disorders, learning, cardiac muscle contraction, oxygen transport, glutamate and dopamine signaling. Specific expression in the claustrum was enriched for genes pertaining to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), severe intellectual disability, epileptic encephalopathy, intracellular transport, spine development, and macroautophagy. We tested for enrichment of genes related to addiction and depression, but they were generally not highly specific to the insula-claustrum region. Exceptions include high insular expression of genes linked to cocaine abuse and genes associated with ever smoking in the claustrum. Brain-wide, we find that markers of the adult claustrum are most specifically expressed in the fetal and adult insula. Altogether, our results provide a novel molecular perspective on the unique properties of the insula and claustrum.© Copyright © 2019 Ibrahim, Le Foll and French.",Frontiers in Neuroanatomy,27-Nov-19

In this context, exploring neural networks of weight control may inform novel treatment strategies for weight-related disorders. In this study, we investigated weight changes after deep brain stimulation of the ventral striatum/ventral capsule and to what extent changes are associated with connectivity to feeding-related networks. We retrospectively analyzed 25 patients undergoing deep brain stimulation for obsessive-compulsive disorder or substance dependency. Weight changes were assessed preoperatively and six to twelve months after surgery and then matched with individual stimulation sites and stimulation-dependent functional connectivity to a priori defined regions of interest that are involved in food intake. We observed a significant weight gain after six to twelve months of continuous stimulation. Weight increases were associated with medial/apical localization of stimulation sites and with connectivity to hypothalamic areas and the bed nucleus. Thus, deep brain stimulation of the ventral striatum/ventral capsule influences weight depending on localization and connectivity of stimulation sites. Bearing in mind the significance of weight-related disorders, we advocate further prospective studies investigating the neuroanatomical and neuropsychological underpinnings of food intake and their neuromodulatory therapeutic potential.Copyright © 2019 by the authors.

ventral tegmentum","Addiction is a major cause of mortality and morbidity. Apart from psychotropic substances, alcohol and nicotine remain the common addictive materials responsible for the majority of deaths. Conventional conservative therapies are beneficial to certain populations, but the majority may require interventional treatments such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) in view of increasing mortality from drug abuse in recent years. We present a brief review on a novel neuromodulation target of the nucleus accumbens (NA) and its promising role in the management of addiction. The three stages of the addiction cycle are known to be mediated by dopaminergic pathways located in the mesolimbic dopamine system with connections to dorsal striatum, extended amygdala, cingulate gyrus, orbitofrontal cortex, prefrontal cortex, and ventral tegmental area. Recent advanced neuroimaging in humans and several animal studies demonstrated NA to be a vital anatomical area modulating this network. DBS of NA in animals reduced addictive behavior to alcohol, cocaine, and other narcotics significantly. The accidental observation that DBS of NA for psychiatric illnesses induced relief from addiction to alcohol and smoking has encouraged further research of late. Bilateral NA ablative surgery had shown nonrelapse in more than 50% of cases. Small series of patients have benefited so far from DBS of NA, but larger numbers are required to provide evidence-based treatment. The modulation of dopaminergic pathways through DBS of NA as a valid treatment for addiction is substantiated extensively by animal studies and also in a few clinical studies. However, this needs to be validated by a well-structured, multicenter controlled study in a large group of patients suffering from substance abuse.Copyright © 2019 Neurology India, Neurological Society of India Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.",Neurology India,September-October 2019

working memory","Mental imagery is a promising tool and mechanism of psychological interventions, particularly for mood and anxiety disorders. In parallel developments, neuromodulation techniques have shown promise as add-on therapies in psychiatry, particularly non-invasive brain stimulation for depression. However, these techniques have not yet been combined in a systematic manner. One novel technology that may be able to achieve this is neurofeedback, which entails the self-regulation of activation in specific brain areas or networks (or the self-modulation of distributed activation patterns) by the patients themselves, through real-time feedback of brain activation (for example, from functional magnetic resonance imaging). One of the key mechanisms by which patients learn such self-regulation is mental imagery. Here, we will first review the main mental imagery approaches in psychotherapy and the implicated brain networks. We will then discuss how these networks can be targeted with neuromodulation (neurofeedback or non-invasive or invasive brain stimulation). We will review the clinical evidence for neurofeedback and discuss possible ways of enhancing it through systematic combination with psychological interventions, with a focus on depression, anxiety disorders, and addiction. The overarching aim of this perspective paper will be to open a debate on new ways of developing neuropsychotherapies.Copyright © 2019 Skottnik and Linden.",Frontiers in Psychiatry,2019

Although participation of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system is well documented, its precise role has not been fully elucidated, and some authors have proposed the involvement of other neural systems in processing specific aspects of reinforced behaviour. Aims and methods: We reviewed published data, including our own findings, on the rewarding effects induced by electrical stimulation of the lateral hypothalamus (LH) and of the external lateral parabrachial area (LPBe) - a brainstem region involved in processing the rewarding properties of natural and artificial substances - and compared its functional characteristics as observed in operant and non-operant behavioural procedures. Result(s): Brain circuits involved in the induction of preferences for stimuli associated with electrical stimulation of the LBPe appear to functionally and neurochemically differ from those activated by electrical stimulation of the LH. Interpretation(s): We discuss the possible involvement of the LPBe in processing emotional-affective aspects of the brain reward system.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.",Journal of Psychopharmacology,01-Dec-19

In order to further our understanding of its neural correlates and to explore its potential relevance as a predictor of treatment response, in this article we systematically reviewed studies involving anhedonia and neuromodulation interventions, across different disorders. Method(s): We included seven studies fulfilling inclusion/exclusion criteria and involving different measures of anticipatory and consummatory anhedonia, as well as different noninvasive brain stimulation interventions (transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation). Studies not exploring hedonic measures or not involving neuromodulation intervention were excluded. Result(s): All the included studies entailed the use of rTMS protocols in one of the diverse prefrontal targets. The limited amount of studies and the heterogeneity of stimulation protocols did not allow to draw any conclusion with regard to the efficacy of rTMS in the treatment of transnosographic anhedonia. A potential for anhedonia in dissecting possible endophenotypes of different psychopathological conditions preliminarily emerged. Conclusion(s): Anhedonia is an underexplored condition in neuromodulation trials. It may represent a valuable transdiagnostic dimension that requires further examination in order to discover new clinical predictors for treatment response.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The present study aimed to investigate the impulsive effects of methamphetamine-related stimuli on working memory (WM) performance by manipulating WM load in abstinent ex-methamphetamine users. Method(s): Thirty abstinent ex-methamphetamine users and 30 nonaddict matched control participants were recruited in this study. We used a modified Sternberg task in which participants were instructed to memorize three different sets of methamphetamine-related and non-drug-related words (three, five, or seven words) while performing a secondary attention-demanding task as an interference. Result(s): Repeated-measures ANOVA revealed that reaction times of abstinent ex-methamphetamine users increased during low WM load (three words) compared to the control group (p = 0.01). No significant differences were observed during high WM loads (five or seven words) (both p's > 0.1). Besides, reaction times of the experimental group during trials with high interference (three, five, or seven words) were not significantly different compared to the control group (p > 0.2). Conclusion(s): These findings imply that increasing WM load may provide an efficient buffer against attentional capture by salient stimuli (i.e., methamphetamine-related words). This buffer might modify the effect of interference bias. Besides, presenting methamphetamine-related stimuli might facilitate the encoding phase due to bias toward task-relevant stimuli. This finding has an important implication, suggesting that performing concurrent demanding tasks may reduce the power of salient stimuli and thus improve the efficiency of emotional regulation strategies.© Copyright © 2019 Deldar, Ekhtiari, Pouretemad and Khatibi.",Frontiers in Psychiatry,22-Oct-19

working memory","Background and Objectives: Treatment models developed for substance use disorders (SUDs) are often applied to behavioral addictions (BAs), even though the correspondence between these forms of addiction is unclear. This is also the case for noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques being investigated as potential treatment interventions for SUDs and BAs. Objective(s): to contribute to the development of more effective NIBS protocols for BAs. Method(s): Two literature searches using PubMed and Google Scholar were conducted identifying a total of 35 studies. The first search identified 25 studies examining the cognitive and neurophysiological overlap between BAs and SUDs. The second search yielded 10 studies examining the effects of NIBS in BAs. Result(s): Impulsivity and cravings show behavioral and neurophysiologic overlaps between BAs and SUDs, however, other outcomes like working-memory abilities or striatal connectivity, differ between BAs and SUDs. The most-employed NIBS target in BAs was dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), which was associated with a decrease in cravings, and less frequently with a reduction of addiction severity. Conclusions and Scientific Significance: Direct comparisons between BAs and SUDs revealed discrepancies between behavioral and neurophysiological outcomes, but overall, common and distinctive characteristics underlying each disorder. The lack of complete overlap between BAs and SUDs suggests that investigating the cognitive and neurophysiological features of BAs to create individual NIBS protocols that target risk-factors associated specifically with BAs, might be more effective than transferring protocols from SUDs to BAs. Individualizing NIBS protocols to target specific risk-factors associated with each BA might help to improve treatment interventions for BAs.

*stem cell transplantation","Drug and alcohol addiction has become an emerging public health issue and is a great burden to patients, their families, and society. It is characterized by high relapse rates and significant morbidity and mortality, and most available treatments result in only modest improvement. These findings highlight the necessity for new approaches to treat addiction. Scientific reports in the past two decades suggest that addiction involves impaired neural plasticity and decreased hippocampal neurogenesis. Stem cell therapy and its derived neurotrophic factors can potentially target the underlying pathophysiology of addiction. Stem cell applications are showing promise in several preclinical studies and may provide new and noninvasive treatment strategies. Future clinical research is warranted to investigate whether stem cell-based therapy could support the treatment of addiction.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.",Cell Transplantation,01-Sep-19

Method(s): We conducted a retrospective study of individuals diagnosed with central pontine myelinolysis (ICD-10 code G37.2) in the Swedish National Patient Register during 1997-2011. Result(s): During the study period, we identified 83 individuals with ODS, 47 women and 36 men. Median age at diagnosis was 55 years. The incidence rate of ODS for the entire study period was 0.611 (95% CI: 0.490-0.754) per million person-years and increased during the study period from 0.271 (95% CI: 0.147-0.460) in 1997-2001 to 0.945 (95% CI: 0.677-1.234) individuals per million person-years in 2007-2011. Most cases (86.7%) were hyponatremic with a median sodium level at admission of 104 mmol/L. All hyponatremic cases were chronic. The cause of hyponatremia was multifactorial, including drugs (56.9%), polydipsia (31.9%), and vomiting or diarrhea (41.7%). A majority of patients (69.9%) were alcoholics. Hyponatremic patients were predominantly treated with isotonic saline (93.1%) and only 4.2% with hypotonic fluids. The median correction rate was 0.72 mmol/L/h. Only six patients were corrected in accordance with national guidelines (<=8 mmol/L/24/h). At three months, 7.2% had died and 60.2% were functionally independent (modified Rankin Scale 0-2). Interpretation(s): We found an increasing incidence during the study period, which could partly be explained by increased access to magnetic resonance imaging. ODS occurs predominantly in patients with extreme chronic hyponatremia which is corrected too fast with isotonic saline. Most patients survived and became functionally independent.Copyright © 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Acta Neurologica Scandinavica,01-Nov-19

withdrawal syndrome","Introduction: Impulse control disorders (ICDs) in Parkinson's disease (PD) are a group of impulsive behaviors most often associated, but not limited to, dopamine replacement therapy (DRT), particularly the use of dopamine agonists (DA). ICDs can impair activities of daily living and have a strong negative impact on quality of life of patients and their families. Areas covered: This review mainly focusses on the most common ICDs in the context of currently accepted management strategies for PD and emphasizes areas of controversy in need of further research. The authors further describe the concept of dopamine agonist withdrawal (DAWS) syndrome and its implication for the treatment of ICDs, the role of recently available antiparkinsonian drugs and routes of delivery, and non-pharmacological treatments. Expert opinion: When ICDs develop, proper management mainly consists of reducing, discontinuing or switching dopaminergic agents, especially of DA. In these scenarios, patients should be closely followed up as their motor condition may deteriorate along with occurrence of DAWS. Assessment of the presence and intensity of ICDs should be carried throughout the course of the disease and not only when a particular treatment is started or when the dosage is increased, since their occurrence is not linearly related to DRT alone.Copyright © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Expert Review of Neurotherapeutics,03-Jun-19

Neither prevention nor treatment efforts are effective in all individuals. Results are often modest. Advances in neuroscience and addiction research have helped to describe the neurobiological changes that occur when a person transitions from recreational substance use to a substance use disorder or addiction. Understanding both the drivers and consequences of substance use in vulnerable populations, including those whose brains are still maturing, has revealed behavioral and biological characteristics that can increase risks of addiction. These findings are particularly timely, as law- and policymakers are tasked to reverse the ongoing opioid epidemic, as more states legalize marijuana, as new products including electronic cigarettes and newly designed abused substances enter the legal and illegal markets, and as ""deaths of despair"" from alcohol and drug misuse continue.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

tobacco dependence / drug therapy","Substance use disorders (SUD) are serious public health problems worldwide. Although significant progress has been made in understanding the neurobiology of drug reward and the transition to addiction, effective pharmacotherapies for SUD remain limited and a majority of drug users relapse even after a period of treatment. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved several medications for opioid, nicotine, and alcohol use disorders, whereas none are approved for the treatment of cocaine or other psychostimulant use disorders. The medications approved by the FDA for the treatment of SUD can be divided into two major classes - agonist replacement therapies, such as methadone and buprenorphine for opioid use disorders (OUD), nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and varenicline for nicotine use disorders (NUD), and antagonist therapies, such as naloxone for opioid overdose and naltrexone for promoting abstinence. In the present review, we primarily focus on the pharmacological rationale of agonist replacement strategies in treatment of opioid dependence, and the potential translation of this rationale to new therapies for cocaine use disorders. We begin by describing the neural mechanisms underlying opioid reward, followed by preclinical and clinical findings supporting the utility of agonist therapies in the treatment of OUD. We then discuss recent progress of agonist therapies for cocaine use disorders based on lessons learned from methadone and buprenorphine. We contend that future studies should identify agonist pharmacotherapies that can facilitate abstinence in patients who are motivated to quit their illicit drug use. Focusing on those that are able to achieve abstinence from cocaine will provide a platform to broaden the effectiveness of medication and psychosocial treatment strategies for this underserved population.

Young Mania Rating Scale","Objectives The use of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in addiction disorders is still on its rise in comparison with pharmacological and psychotherapeutic strategies that still show low level of evidence. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the anodic tDCS for the short-term treatment of substance craving and other psychiatric symptoms. Methods In this randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial, inclusion criteria included the diagnosis of substance use disorder and/or gambling disorder. The protocol includes 5 consecutive days of active or sham tDCS session. Cathode was placed over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Young Mania Rating Scale, Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, South Oaks Gambling Screen, and visual analog scale (VAS) 1 to 10 for craving were administered at the baseline (T0) and after 5 days of treatment (T1). Results Thirty-four treatment-seeking subjects were randomized to sham (n = 16) and active stimulation (n = 18) groups. A statistically significant reduction of values at T1 was found in all subjects considering VAS (P < 0.001), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (P < 0.001), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (P < 0.001), and Barratt Impulsiveness Scale 11 (P = 0.032). A significant reduction for VAS craving in favor of the active stimulation (P = 0.011) was found. Conclusions Our findings reveal a statistically significant rapid reduction of craving in the active tDCS group on the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex with respect to sham group, confirming the scientific literature trend. Large samples, with maintenance tDCS therapy and long-term follow-up, are required to establish the potential of this noninvasive and easily delivered brain stimulation strategy.Copyright © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

vagus nerve stimulation","Closed-loop or intelligent neuromodulation allows adjustable, personalized neuromodulation which usually incorporates the recording of a biomarker, followed by implementation of an algorithm which decides the timing (when?) and strength (how much?) of stimulation. Closed-loop neuromodulation has been shown to have greater benefits compared to open-loop neuromodulation, particularly for therapeutic applications such as pharmacoresistant epilepsy, movement disorders and potentially for psychological disorders such as depression or drug addiction. However, an important aspect of the technique is selection of an appropriate, preferably neural biomarker. Neurochemical sensing can provide high resolution biomarker monitoring for various neurological disorders as well as offer deeper insight into neurological mechanisms. The chemicals of interest being measured, could be ions such as potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), calcium (Ca2+), chloride (Cl-), hydrogen (H+) or neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin and glutamate. This review focusses on the different building blocks necessary for a neurochemical, closed-loop neuromodulation system including biomarkers, sensors and data processing algorithms. Furthermore, it also highlights the merits and drawbacks of using this biomarker modality.Copyright © 2019 Mirza, Golden, Nikolic and Toumazou.

Available medical records, death scene investigation reports, autopsy reports, and next-of-kin interviews were reviewed for all cases of SUDEP. Seizure type, EEG, MRI, and SUDEP classification were adjudicated by 2 epileptologists.ResultsThere were 237 definite and probable cases of SUDEP among 530 NASR participants. SUDEP decedents had a median age of 26 (range 1-70) years at death, and 38% were female. In 143 with sufficient information, 40% had generalized and 60% had focal epilepsy. SUDEP affected the full spectrum of epilepsies, from benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (n = 3, 1%) to intractable epileptic encephalopathies (n = 27, 11%). Most (93%) SUDEPs were unwitnessed; 70% occurred during apparent sleep; and 69% of patients were prone. Only 37% of cases of SUDEP took their last dose of antiseizure medications (ASMs). Reported lifetime generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) were <10 in 33% and 0 in 4%.ConclusionsNASR participants commonly have clinical features that have been previously been associated with SUDEP risk such as young adult age, ASM nonadherence, and frequent GTCS. However, a sizeable minority of SUDEP occurred in patients thought to be treatment responsive or to have benign epilepsies. These results emphasize the importance of SUDEP education across the spectrum of epilepsy severities. We aim to make NASR data and biospecimens available for researchers to advance SUDEP understanding and prevention.Copyright © American Academy of Neurology.",Neurology,16-Jul-19

*transcranial magnetic stimulation","Adolescent depression is a substantial global public health problem that contributes to academic failure, occupational impairment, deficits in social functioning, substance use disorders, teen pregnancy, and completed suicide. Existing treatment options often have suboptimal results and uncertain safety profiles. Transcranial magnetic stimulation may be a promising, brain-based intervention for adolescents with depression. Existing work has methodological weaknesses, and larger, neurodevelopmentally informed studies are urgently needed. Treatment with transcranial magnetic stimulation may modulate cortical GABAergic and glutamatergic imbalances. Future study will inform dosing approaches for TMS based on GABAergic and glutamatergic biomarkers.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America,Jan-19

*transcranial electrical stimulation","Headache is the one of the most common problems contributing to suffering worldwide and sometimes it causes disability. Some patients are unable to use the drugs for various reasons and some are resistant to the pharmacological treatment. Therefore, additional effective non-pharmacological treatments are sought. Transcranial electrical stimulation techniques have been developed as potential therapeutic options. Among these techniques, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is the only technique studied for the treatment of headache. TDCS is a neurophysiological technique with multifarious advantages encompassing its low-cost, high tolerability and acceptability, comfortable application and the opportunity to use concomi-tantly with other treatments. Steadily increasing interest in tDCS stems from the multidisciplinary advances in neuroscientific backgrounds of neuropsychiatric diseases. Even though exact mechanisms behind benefits of tDCS have not yet been clearly disclosed, changes in multitudinous chemical and physiological parameters have been demonstrated. The purpose of this review is to summarize what is currently known regarding the effects of tDCS on the treatment of headache focusing mostly on migraine. Herein, tDCS procedures that may be helpful for primary headache treatment were described. TDCS has shown promise for effectively treating primary headaches with no severe adverse effects. The findings indicate that the analgesic effects of tDCS can last for a long period and can occur after the time of stimulation. Additional research is required for the determination of optimized stimulation protocols in each specific headache disorder.Copyright © 2019, AVES.

A widespread and still growing number of studies have reported beneficial use of repeated TMS (rTMS) in reduction of craving, intake and cue-induced craving in cocaine addicts. In spite of these encouraging findings, many issues are still unresolved such as brain area to be stimulated, laterality of the effects, coil geometry and stimulation protocols/parameters. Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) is a more tolerable protocol administered at lower intensities and shorter intervals than conventional rTMS protocols. Yet, its effects on cocaine craving and length of abstinence in comparison with standard high frequency (10-15 Hz) protocols have never been evaluated so far. In the present paper, we describe the effect of the bilateral iTBS of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in a population (n = 25) of treatment-seeking cocaine addicts, in an outpatient setting, and compare them with 15 Hz stimulation of the same brain area (n = 22). The results indicate that iTBS produces effects on cocaine consumption and cocaine craving virtually superimposable to the 15 Hz rTMS group. Both treatments had low numbers of dropouts and similar side-effects, safety and tolerability profiles. While larger studies are warranted to confirm these observations, iTBS appears to be a valid approach to be considered in treatment-seeking cocaine addicts, especially in light of its brief duration (3 min) vs. 15 Hz stimulation (15 min). The use of iTBS would allow increasing the number of patients treated per day with current rTMS devices, thus reducing patient discomfort and hopefully reducing drop-out rates without compromising clinical effectiveness.Copyright © 2019 Sanna, Fattore, Badas, Corona, Cocco and Diana.

*ventromedial prefrontal cortex","Cue-induced craving is a significant barrier to obtaining abstinence from cocaine. Neuroimaging research has shown that cocaine cue exposure evokes elevated activity in a network of frontal-striatal brain regions involved in drug craving and drug seeking. Prior research from our laboratory has demonstrated that when targeted at the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), an inhibitory form of non-invasive brain stimulation, can decrease drug cue-related activity in the striatum in cocaine users and alcohol users. However, it is known that there are individual differences in response to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), with some individuals being responders and others non-responders. There is some evidence that state-dependent effects influence response to rTMS, with baseline neural state predicting rTMS treatment outcomes. In this single-blind, active sham-controlled crossover study, we assess the striatum as a biomarker of treatment response by determining if baseline drug cue reactivity in the striatum influences striatal response to mPFC cTBS. The brain response to cocaine cues was measured in 19 cocaine-dependent individuals immediately before and after real and sham cTBS (110% resting motor threshold, 3600 total pulses). Group independent component analysis (ICA) revealed a prominent striatum network comprised of bilateral caudate, putamen, and nucleus accumbens, which was modulated by the cocaine cue reactivity task. Baseline drug cue reactivity in this striatal network was inversely related to change in striatum reactivity after real (vs. sham) cTBS treatment (rho = -.79; p < .001; R2Adj = .58). Specifically, individuals with a high striatal response to cocaine cues at baseline had significantly attenuated striatal activity after real but not sham cTBS (t9 = -3.76; p <= .005). These data demonstrate that the effects of mPFC cTBS on the neural circuitry of craving are not uniform and may depend on an individual's baseline frontal-striatal reactivity to cues. This underscores the importance of assessing individual variability as we develop brain stimulation treatments for addiction.Copyright © 2019 Kearney-Ramos, Dowdle, Mithoefer, Devries, George and Hanlon.

Reduced cortical excitability has been shown among chronic smokers compared with non-smokers to have a long-term effect and so far no study has assessed the effect of smoking on short-term motor learning. Paired associative stimulation (PAS) is a commonly used method for inducing changes in excitability of the motor cortex (M1) in a way that simulates short-term motor learning. This study employed PAS to investigate the effect of chronic cigarette smoking on plasticity of M1. Stimulator output required to elicit a motor-evoked potential (MEP) of approximately 1 mV was similar between the groups prior to PAS. MEP response to single pulse stimuli increased in the control group and remained above baseline level for at least 30 min after the intervention, but not in the smokers who showed no significant increase in MEP size. The silent period was similar between groups at all time points of the experiment. This study suggests that chronic smoking may have a negative effect on the response to PAS and infers that chronic smoking may have a deleterious effect on the adaptability of M1.Copyright © 2019, MDPI AG.

Patients should be made fully aware of the potential benefits and complications of surgery and that their expectations are realistic. The most important issues regarding DBS are that the diagnosis is correct, that the patient has had an adequate trial of medical therapy, and that the odds of improvement are substantial when weighed against the risks. Consideration must also be given to physical, psychological, and socioeconomic issues. The potential of DBS to keep patients employed and functioning socially should be the highest priority. Although VIM DBS is the surgical treatment of choice in ET, newer ablative approaches, such as focused ultrasound, should be discussed.Copyright © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,2019

Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale","Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)with comorbid bipolar affective disorder (BPAD)is often faced with a therapeutic challenge. Pharmacological treatment strategy engaged towards alleviating symptoms in OCD has the propensity to precipitate a manic switch in patients with comorbid BPAD. Advanced non-invasive brain stimulation techniques like high definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS)may target the symptoms of OCD while preventing a probable manic switch in a vulnerable population. In this case series, we targeted OC symptoms in three patients by giving 2 mA of anodal HD-tDCS at their pre-SMA (localized using 10/10 EEG system)with 4 surrounding return electrodes of opposite polarity for 20 min of two sessions having an intersession gap of 20 min receiving a maximum of 20 sessions. We found that the patients showed significant improvement (more than 25%)in their OC symptoms while having no affective side effects and this effect was replicated in one of the two patients in repeating the treatment for relapse. This case series highlights the efficacy and durability of the effect of HD-tDCS as an add-on treatment modality in three patients who were treated for OC symptoms in the context of a comorbid bipolar disorder, two of them receiving repeat courses on relapse.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Asian Journal of Psychiatry,Jun-19

treatment outcome","The United States is in the midst of an opioid epidemic and lacks a range of successful interventions to reduce this public health burden. Many individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) consume drugs to relieve physical and/or emotional pain, a pattern that may increasingly result in death. The field of addiction research lacks a comprehensive understanding of physiological and neural mechanisms instantiating this cycle of Negative Reinforcement in OUD, resulting in limited interventions that successfully promote abstinence and recovery. Given the urgency of the opioid crisis, the present review highlights faulty brain circuitry and processes associated with OUD within the context of the Three-Stage Model of Addiction (1). This model underscores Negative Reinforcement processes as crucial to the maintenance and exacerbation of chronic substance use together with Binge/Intoxication and Preoccupation/Anticipation processes. This review focuses on cross-sectional as well as longitudinal studies of relapse and treatment outcome that employ magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRs), brain stimulation methods, and/or electroencephalography (EEG) explored in frequency and time domains (the latter measured by event-related potentials, or ERPs). We discuss strengths and limitations of this neuroimaging work with respect to study design and individual differences that may influence interpretation of findings (e.g., opioid use chronicity/recency, comorbid symptoms, and biological sex). Lastly, we translate gaps in the OUD literature, particularly with respect to Negative Reinforcement processes, into future research directions involving operant and classical conditioning involving aversion/stress. Overall, opioid-related stimuli may lessen their hold on frontocingulate mechanisms implicated in Preoccupation/Anticipation as a function of prolonged abstinence and that degree of frontocingulate impairment may predict treatment outcome. In addition, longitudinal studies suggest that brain stimulation/drug treatments and prolonged abstinence can change brain responses during Negative Reinforcement and Preoccupation/Anticipation to reduce salience of drug cues, which may attenuate further craving and relapse. Incorporating this neuroscience-derived knowledge with the Three-Stage Model of Addiction may offer a useful plan for delineating specific neurobiological targets for OUD treatment.Copyright © 2019 Stewart, May, Aupperle and Bodurka.",Frontiers in Psychiatry,2019

Reward aids in seeking foods that bring energy and pleasant taste, whose consumption is safe. As evidenced by the obesity ""epidemic"" which largely stems from overeating, reward becomes a detriment when palatable tastants are available in unlimited quantities. This review presents recent evidence on mechanisms underlying palatability-driven excessive consumption of sugar. Recent Findings: Appetite for sugar is propelled by changes in the morphology and activity of the reward system reminiscent of addiction. Sugar intake also shifts the hunger-satiety continuum, facilitating initiation of consumption in the absence of energy needs and maintenance of feeding despite ingestion of large food loads that endanger homeostasis. Summary: Ingestion of excessive amounts of sugar relies on triggering mechanisms that promote addictive-like behaviors, and on overriding neuroendocrine signals that protect internal milieu.Copyright © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Current Nutrition Reports,01-Jun-19

The anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC) is also a potential target, as it carries fiber tracts connecting the mesocorticolimbic circuits that are crucially involved in several psychiatric disorders, including addiction. Stimulating the NAc and ALIC simultaneously may have a synergistic effect against addiction. Method(s): Eight patients with a long history of heroin use and multiple relapses, despite optimal conventional treatments, were enrolled. Customized electrodes were implanted through the ALIC into the NAc, and deep brain stimulation (DBS) treatment began two weeks after surgery. The patients were followed for at least 24 months. The duration of drug-free time, severity of drug cravings, psychometric evaluations, and PET studies of glucose metabolism before and after DBS were conducted. All adverse events were recorded. Result(s): With DBS, five patients were abstinent for more than three years, two relapsed after abstaining for six months, and one was lost of follow-up at three months. The degree of cravings for drug use after DBS was reduced if the patients remained abstinent (p < 0.001). Simultaneous DBS of the NAc and ALIC also improved the quality of life, alleviated psychiatric symptoms, and increased glucose metabolism in addiction-related brain regions. Moreover, stimulation-related adverse events were few and reversible. Conclusion(s): Simultaneous DBS of the NAc and ALIC appears to be safe, with few side effects, and may prevent long-term heroin relapse after detoxification in certain patients.

However, the implement of DBS treatment in addicted patients is currently controversial due to the significant associated risks. The aim of this study was mainly to investigate the therapeutic efficacy and safety of bilateral DBS of nucleus accumbens and the anterior limb of the internal capsule (NAc/ALIC-DBS) in patients with refractory opioid dependence (ROD). Methods and analysis: 60 patients with ROD will be enrolled in this multicentre, prospective, double-blinded study, and will be followed up for 25 weeks (6 months) after surgery. Patients with ROD (semisynthetic opioids) who meet the criteria for NAc/ALIC-DBS surgery will be allocated to either the early stimulation group or the late stimulation group (control group) based on the randomised ID number. The primary outcome was defined as the abstinence rate at 25 weeks after DBS stimulation on, which will be confirmed by an opiate urine tests. The secondary outcomes include changes in the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score for craving for opioid drugs, body weight, as well as psychological evaluation measured using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Fagerstrom test for nicotine dependence assessment, social disability screening schedule, the Activity of Daily Living Scale, the 36-item Short Form-Health Survey and safety profiles of both groups. Ethics and dissemination: The study received ethical approval from the medical ethical committee of Tangdu Hospital, The Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, China. The results of this study will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at international conferences.Copyright © 2019 Author(s).",BMJ Open,01-Feb-19

treatment indication","The clinical use of deep brain stimulation (DBS) is among the most important advances in the clinical neurosciences in the past two decades. As a surgical tool, DBS can directly measure pathological brain activity and can deliver adjustable stimulation for therapeutic effect in neurological and psychiatric disorders correlated with dysfunctional circuitry. The development of DBS has opened new opportunities to access and interrogate malfunctioning brain circuits and to test the therapeutic potential of regulating the output of these circuits in a broad range of disorders. Despite the success and rapid adoption of DBS, crucial questions remain, including which brain areas should be targeted and in which patients. This Review considers how DBS has facilitated advances in our understanding of how circuit malfunction can lead to brain disorders and outlines the key unmet challenges and future directions in the DBS field. Determining the next steps in DBS science will help to define the future role of this technology in the development of novel therapeutics for the most challenging disorders affecting the human brain.Copyright © 2019, Springer Nature Limited.",Nature Reviews Neurology,01-Mar-19

transcranial direct current stimulation","Objective: Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques, such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), are increasingly being used to treat mental disorders, particularly major depression. The aim of this comprehensive review is to summarize the main advances, limitations, and perspectives of the field. Method(s): We searched PubMed and other databases from inception to July 2017 for articles, particularly systematic reviews and meta-analyses, evaluating the use of NIBS in psychiatric disorders. Result(s): We reviewed the mechanisms of action, safety, tolerability, efficacy, and relevant clinical parameters of NIBS. Repetitive TMS is already an established technique for the treatment of depression, and there is theoretically room for further methodological development towards a high-end therapeutic intervention. In contrast, tDCS is a technically easier method and therefore potentially suitable for wider clinical use. However the evidence of its antidepressant efficacy is less sound, and a recent study found tDCS to be inferior to antidepressant pharmacotherapy. Clinical trials using rTMS for other mental disorders produced mixed findings, whereas tDCS use has not been sufficiently appraised. Conclusion(s): The most promising results of NIBS have been obtained for depression. These techniques excel in safety and tolerability, although their efficacy still warrants improvement.Copyright © 2019, Associacao Brasileira de Psiquiatria.

smoking","The nucleus accumbens (NA) and the cingulate gyrus (CG) are two vital limbic brain structures. They have attracted attention as deep brain stimulation (DBS) targets in the treatment of common refractory psychiatric illness. The primary purpose of this article was to review the current knowledge regarding the way that NA DBS affects the CG and vice versa. Methodologically, a thorough literature review was performed. According to the current literature, NA DBS modulates the function of several brain areas including the CG cortex. It specifically causes activation in the ipsilateral CG cortex and voltage-dependent reduction of its blood oxygenation. It also reverses anterior mid-CG cortex dysfunction and decreases metabolism in the subgenual CG. Moreover, NA DBS that induces mirth inhibits the function of the anterior CG cortex and enhances effective connectivity from anterior CG to the ventral striatum. On the other hand, although it is highly probable that CG DBS affects the NA, the exact nature of its effects remains unclear. Despite the increasing interest in psychiatric DBS, the available data on how NA DBS affects the CG and vice versa are restricted. This conclusion probably reflects the high complexity of the limbic circuits and necessitates further research.Copyright © 2019 by the author.

yoga","Adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has a population prevalence of 5%. However, its prevalence is much higher in mental health and substance use treatment settings. It is associated with significant physical and psychiatric morbidity, as well as social, occupational, and legal consequences. Adult ADHD is considered to be a part of the externalizing spectrum with which it shares both homotypic comorbidity and heterotypic continuity across the lifespan. This is attributable to a shared genetic basis, which interacts with environmental risk factors such as nutritional deficiencies and psychosocial adversity to bring about epigenetic changes. This is seen to result in a lag in brain maturation particularly in the areas of the brain related to executive functioning (top-down regulation) such as the prefrontal and cingulate cortices. This delay when coupled with impairments in reward processing, leads to a preference for immediate small rewards and is common to externalizing disorders. Adult ADHD is increasingly understood to not merely be associated with the classically described symptoms of hyperactivity, impulsivity and inattention, but also issues with motivation, emotional recognition and regulation, excessive mind wandering, and behavioral self-regulation. These symptoms are also observed in other disorders which overlap with the externalizing spectrum such as oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, antisocial and borderline personality disorder. It is therefore important to develop both broad-based and specific interventions to be able to target these deficits which can reduce the burden and improve outcomes.Copyright © 2019 Indian Journal of Psychiatry.",Indian Journal of Psychiatry,January-February 2019

Method(s): A comprehensive literature search was conducted through EBSCOhost regarding the neurological therapies in the treatment of alcoholism discussed in this paper. Result(s): To date, few studies have been conducted on the subject, sample sizes are consistently small, and long-term abstinence appears a common problem. tDCS has shown to temporarily reduce alcohol cravings but with a high number of long-term relapses, 50-70%. DBS and TMS, similarly, fail to overcome high relapse rates. In one DBS study, for example, only two of five patients achieved prolonged abstinence. ECT seems to avoid such problems, but only a single case study exists to date. As such, no solid conclusions can be made regarding its success in alcohol addiction treatment. Baclofen, however, implicated in studies with comparatively larger patient samples and higher efficacy rates, presents with great promise, particularly in patients with more severe forms of AUD. In one of the largest observational studies to date (100 subjects) 92% of patients reported craving suppression and long-term relapse rates were low. The side-effects of oral baclofen (i.e., somnolence, insomnia, dizziness, paresthesia, etc.) though, pose a principle limitation to its administration in alcohol addiction. Conclusion(s): Based on current information in the literature, the authors advocate that, following more extensive research on oral baclofen and its indications in the treatment of alcohol addiction, intrathecal administration be the next logical therapeutic option to be explored. In particular, those patients with severe AUD, requiring high doses of the medication, may benefit, as it eliminates the systemic side effects associated with oral baclofen.Copyright © 2017 International Neuromodulation Society",Neuromodulation,Feb-18

Our objective, in this review, is to highlight some of the emerging applications of DBS within three distinct but overlapping spheres, namely trauma, neuropsychiatry, and autonomic physiology. Review Methods: An extensive literature review was carried out in MEDLINE, to identify relevant studies and review articles describing applications of DBS in the areas of trauma, neuropsychiatry and autonomic neuroscience. Result(s): A wide range of applications of DBS in these spheres was identified, some having only been tested in one or two cases, others much better studied. Conclusion(s): We have identified various avenues for DBS to be applied for patient benefit in cases relevant to trauma, neuropsychiatry and autonomic neuroscience. Further developments in DBS technology and clinical trial design will enable these novel applications to be effectively and rigorously assessed and utilized most effectively.Copyright © 2017 International Neuromodulation Society",Neuromodulation,Feb-18

Review","Alcohol intake is facilitated by its relationship with eating behavior and both processes are highly influenced by situations of stress and anxiety. The dysregulation of these processes can reach pathological situations such as anorexia, bulimia or obesity. The neurobiological elements which underlie this control are not completely clarified. The nucleus incertus (NI) in the pontine tegmentum is a common element in the food intake and alcoholism. NI is characterized by using the neuropeptide relaxin-3 (RLN3) as transmitter and its receptor RXFP3. In the present review, we will analyze the participation of the NI-RLN3-RXFP3 system in these behaviors under conditions of anxiety or stress in animal models. The activation of NI has a positive effect on intake (orexigenic) and generates a wide response in the amygdala modulating anxiety states. The activity of RLN3-RXFP3 in the amygdala could affect alcohol addiction since the application of the RXFP3 antagonist in extended amygdala attenuates the relapse to alcohol induced by stress. The neuroanatomical data indicate that the NI-RLN3-RXFP3 system acts on the feeding behavior and alcohol intake by means of projections parallel to the canonical mesolimbic pathways. Thus, data in animal models indicate that the NI-RLN3-RXFP3 system should be taken into account as a target in the future treatment of disorders of eating and alcohol addictive behaviors.Copyright © 2018 Revista de Neurologia.",Revista de Neurologia,01-Sep-18

treatment response","Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been offered to patients suffering of severe and resistant neuropsychiatric disorders like Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome (TS) and Major Depression (MDD). Modulation of several targets within the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits can lead to a decrease of symptom severity in those patients. This review focuses on the recent clinical outcomes in DBS in psychiatric disorders. Studies on OCD and TS are now focusing on the long-term effects of DBS, with encouraging results regarding not only the decrease of symptoms, but also quality of life. They also highlighted efficient adjuvant techniques, like cognitive and behavioural therapy and support programs, to enhance an often-partial response to DBS. The application of DBS for MDD is more recent and, despite encouraging initial open-label studies, two large randomised studies have failed to demonstrate an efficacy of DBS in MDD according to evidence-based medicine criteria. Last years, DBS was also tested in other resistant psychiatric disorders, as anorexia nervosa and addiction, with encouraging preliminary results. However, today, no target - whatever the disease - can meet the criteria for clinical efficacy as recently defined by an international committee for neurosurgery for psychiatric disorders. Consequently, DBS in psychiatric disorders still needs to proceed within the frame of clinical trials.Copyright © 2018 Clair AH et al.",F1000Research,2018

New treatment modalities are therefore warranted. One of the options is deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus accumbens (NAC). This review aims to summarize the current knowledge on NAC-DBS for the treatment of morbid obesity. METHODS Studies were obtained from multiple electronic bibliographic databases, supplemented with searches of reference lists. All animal and human studies reporting on the effects of NAC-DBS on body weight in morbidly obese patients were included. Articles found during the search were screened by 2 reviewers, and when deemed applicable, the relevant data were extracted. RESULTS Five relevant animal experimental papers were identified, pointing toward a beneficial effect of high-frequency stimulation of the lateral shell of the NAC. Three human case reports show a beneficial effect of NAC-DBS on body weight in morbidly obese patients. CONCLUSIONS The available literature supports NAC-DBS to treat morbid obesity. The number of well-conducted animal studies, however, is very limited. Also, the optimal anatomical position of the DBS electrode within the NAC, as well as the optimal stimulation parameters, has not yet been established. These matters need to be addressed before this strategy can be considered for human clinical trials.",Neurosurgical focus,01-Aug-18

New therapies are needed, and deep brain stimulation (DBS) may be an effective treatment. The past 15 years have seen numerous animal DBS studies for addiction to various drugs of abuse, with most reporting decreases in drug-seeking behavior with stimulation. The most common target for stimulation has been the nucleus accumbens, a key structure in the mesolimbic reward pathway. In addiction, the mesolimbic reward pathway undergoes a series of neuroplastic changes. Chief among them is a relative hypofunctioning of the prefrontal cortex, which is thought to lead to the diminished impulse control that is characteristic of drug addiction. The prefrontal cortex, as well as other targets involved in drug addiction such as the lateral habenula, hypothalamus, insula, and subthalamic nucleus have also been stimulated in animals, with encouraging results. Although animal studies have largely shown promising results, current DBS studies for drug addiction primarily use stimulation during active drug use. More data are needed on the effect of DBS during withdrawal in preventing future relapse. The published human experience for DBS for drug addiction is currently limited to several promising case series or case reports that are not controlled. Further animal and human work is needed to determine what role DBS can play in the treatment of drug addiction.",Neurosurgical focus,01-Aug-18

Long-term observation in a large cohort allows a better counselling and management. Methods To determine whether a long-term treatment with subthalamic stimulation induces or reduces impulse control behaviours, neuropsychiatric fluctuations and apathy, 69 patients treated with subthalamic stimulation are prospectively and retrospectively assessed using Ardouin Scale of Behavior in Parkinson's Disease before and after 3-10 years of stimulation. Results At a mean follow-up of 6 years, all impulse control disorders and dopaminergic addiction were significantly decreased, apart from eating behaviour and hypersexuality. Neuropsychiatric fluctuations also significantly improved (ON euphoria: 38% of the patients before surgery and 1% after surgery, P<0.01; OFF dysphoria: 39% of the patients before surgery and 10% after surgery, P<0.01). However, apathy increased (25% of the patients after surgery and 3% before, P<0.01). With the retrospective analysis, several transient episodes of depression, apathy, anxiety and impulse control disorders occurred. Conclusions Bilateral subthalamic nucleus stimulation was overall very effective in improving impulse control disorders and neuropsychiatric fluctuations in parkinsonian patients in the long term despite a counteracting frequent apathy. Transient episodes of impulse control disorders still occurred within the follow-up. These findings recommend a close follow-up in parkinsonian patients presenting with neuropsychiatric symptoms before deep brain stimulation surgery.

Our understanding of substance use disorder has advanced significantly over the last 3 decades in part due to major progress in genetics and neuroscience research and to the development of new technologies, including tools to interrogate molecular changes in specific neuronal populations in animal models of substance use disorder, as well as brain imaging devices to assess brain function and neuro-chemistry in humans. These advances have illuminated the neurobiological processes through which biological and sociocultural factors contribute to resilience against or vulnerability for drug use and addiction.

*treatment indication

tremor / therapy","It has been three decades since the first application of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for tremors was described by Benabid. Over the years, the indications for the performance of DBS have been expanding. There are now more than 1,50,000 patients around the world who have undergone DBS for various disorders. The main appeal of DBS is in its reversibility and titratability. Though the initial interest in DBS was for pain, the main indications for DBS have been movement disorders. Despite its wide appeal and 'perceived' advantage, United States Food and Drug Administration, the nodal agency for approving therapies, has been cautious and guarded in providing approvals. Only two indications, i.e., Parkinson's disease and tremors, have been approved; the two other indications, i.e., dystonia and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), have been granted exemption under the humanitarian device usage. However, the European community has been more liberal and several of these indications have CE (Conformite Europeene) approval. Most of them will be reviewed in this article. There have been numerous indications for which DBS has been applied, which in turn has helped to change the lives of several patients. Unfortunately, due to the paucity of the number of procedures performed and the inherent difficulty in conducting 'surgical' double blind randomized trials, Class 1 or Class 2 evidence for several of these indications is lacking. Hence, it is advisable that one does not embark on using each and any target for each and any indication without having the understanding or the team backup. It is cautionary that most of these therapies should be conducted in an institutional setting with an ethics and scientific committee backup and ably assisted by an experienced team.Copyright © 2018 Neurology India, Neurological Society of India  Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.",Neurology India,March-April 2018

screening test","Impulsive-compulsive behavior (ICB) in Parkinson's disease (PD) suggests a combination of impulse control disorders (ICDs), such as pathological gambling, hypersexuality, compulsive eating, excessive buying, and compulsive behaviors, such as punding, dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS), hoarding, and hobbyism. Hypersexuality and gambling are common in male patients while compulsive buying is common in women patients. Recent studies reveal the prevalence of ICB to be more than 25% among the PD patients. The nigrostriatal, mesocortical, and mesolimbic dopaminergic pathways play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of ICDs in PD patients. The greater tonic release of dopamine creates a state of relative dopamine deficit and reduced reward sensation and impulsive behaviors. The major risk factors for ICB are the use of dopamine agonist (DA), male gender, young patient, depression, smoking, drug abuse, Parkin mutation, and family history of ICDs. Single nucleotide polymorphism in dopamine receptors D1, D2, and D3 also acts as a major risk factor. Questionnaire for impulsive-compulsive disorders in PD is the most widely adopted screening tool for the detection of ICB in PD. The major treatment for PD is to discontinue DAs and use prolonged release formulation of the DAs. The role of deep brain stimulation (DBS) and apomorphine in the treatment of ICB is still uncertain. Though DBS can reduce the risk of DDS, it can precipitate new ICBs such as hypersexuality.Copyright © 2018 Neurology India, Neurological Society of India  Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.",Neurology India,July-August 2018

Our study aimed to explore the functions of NAc and ALIC electrophysiologically. Method(s): The local field potentials (LFPs) of the NAc and ALIC were recorded from 7 heroin addicts treated with deep brain stimulation. Correlation analysis was made between LFP powers in various frequency bands and the subjects' neuropsychological test scores; coherence was calculated for the LFPs in NAc and ALIC. Result(s): Both the NAc and ALIC exhibited prominent theta and alpha frequency band activity in the LFP power spectra. Additionally, a distinct beta band peak was detected in the power spectra of ALIC LFPs, which may represent the activity of striatal bridge cells. There was a significant negative correlation between the power of the theta frequency band of ALIC LFPs and visual analogue scale (VAS) scores indicative of cravings (Spearman's rho = -0.758, P = 0.002), and a significant positive correlation was found between the power of the alpha frequency band of NAc LFPs and subjects' scores on the Hamilton depression inventory (rho = 0.727, P = 0.005). LFPs of the NAc and ALIC exhibited higher coherence values in the theta and alpha frequency bands. Conclusion(s): The results suggest that theta power in the ALIC/dorsal striatum and alpha power in the NAc may be associated with drug cravings and depressive symptoms, respectively, in heroin addicts. For these subjects, the neural activities in the dorsal and ventral striatum were mainly coordinated within the low-frequency band. Significance: The study illustrates the neurophysiologic characteristics of heroin addiction and its comorbidities, providing a potential theoretical basis for optimizing deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapy.Copyright © 2018 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology",Clinical Neurophysiology,Jun-18

While several pharmacological and behavioral treatments for SUDs are available, these may not be effective for all patients. Recent studies using non-invasive neuromodulation techniques including Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS), Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS), and Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) have shown promise for SUD treatment. Objective(s): Multiple studies were evaluated investigating the therapeutic potential of non-invasive brain stimulation techniques in treatment of SUDs. Method(s): Through literature searches (eg, PubMed, Google Scholar), 60 studies (2000-2017) were identified examining the effect of rTMS, tDCS, or DBS on cravings and consumption of SUDs, including tobacco, alcohol, cannabis, opioids, and stimulants. Result(s): rTMS and tDCS demonstrated decreases in drug craving and consumption, while early studies with DBS suggest similar results. Results are most encouraging when stimulation is targeted to the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC). Conclusion(s): Short-term treatment with rTMS and tDCS may have beneficial effects on drug craving and consumption. Future studies should focus on extending therapeutic benefits by increasing stimulation frequency and duration of treatment. Scientific Significance: The utility of these methods in SUD treatment and prevention are unclear, and warrants further study using randomized, controlled designs.

ventriculostomy","The cerebellum characteristically has the capacity to compensate for and restore lost functions. These compensatory/restorative properties are explained by an abundant synaptic plasticity and the convergence of multimodal central and peripheral signals. In addition, extra-cerebellar structures contribute also to the recovery after a cerebellar injury. Clinically, some patients show remarkable improvement of severe ataxic symptoms associated with trauma, stroke, metabolism, or immune-mediated cerebellar ataxia (IMCA, e.g., multiple sclerosis, paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, gluten ataxia, anti-GAD65 antibody-associated cerebellar ataxia). However, extension of a cerebellar lesion can impact upon the fourth ventricle or the brainstem, either by direct or indirect mechanisms, leading to serious complications. Moreover, cerebellar reserve itself is affected by advanced cell loss and, at some point of disease progression, deficits become irreversible. Such phase transition from a treatable/restorable state (the reserve is still sufficient) to an untreatable state (the reserve is severely affected) is a loss of therapeutic opportunity, highlighting the need for early treatment during the restorable stage. Based on the motto of ""Time is Brain,"" a warning that stresses the importance of early therapeutic intervention in ischemic diseases, we propose ""Time is Cerebellum"" as a principle in the management of patients with cerebellar diseases, especially immune ataxias whose complexity often delay the therapeutic intervention. Indeed, this concept should not be restricted to ischemic cerebellar diseases. We argue that every effort should be made to reduce the diagnostic delay and to initiate early therapy to avoid the risk of transition from a treatable state to an irreversible condition and an associated accumulation of disability. The myriad of disorders affecting the cerebellum is a challenging factor that may contribute to irreversible disability if the window of therapeutic opportunity is missed.Copyright © 2018, The Author(s).",Cerebellum,01-Aug-18

Long-term changes in reward-related brain functioning for non-drug incentives may elucidate patterns of functioning that potentially contribute to ongoing smoking behaviour in current smokers. Similarly, examining the effects of previous chronic nicotine exposure during a period of extended abstinence may reveal whether there are neural correlates responsible for non-drug reward processing that are different from current smokers. The current study, therefore, sets out to examine the neural correlates of reward and loss anticipation, and their respective outcomes, in smokers, ex-smokers and matched controls using a monetary incentive delay task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Here, we report that in the absence of any significant behavioural group differences, both smokers and ex-smokers showed a significantly greater activation change in the lateral orbitofrontal/anterior insular cortex compared with smokers when anticipating both potential monetary gains and losses. We further report that ex-smokers showed a significantly greater activation change in the ventral putamen compared with both controls and smokers and in the caudate compared with controls during the anticipation of potential monetary losses only. The results suggest that smoking may sensitize striato-orbitofrontal circuitry subserving motivational processes for loss avoidance and reward gain in nicotine addiction.Copyright © 2016 Society for the Study of Addiction",Addiction Biology,Jan-18

*ventromedial prefrontal cortex","The ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) has been implicated in a variety of social, cognitive, and affective functions that are commonly disrupted in mental illness. In this review, we summarize data from a diverse array of human and animal studies demonstrating that the vmPFC is a key node of cortical and subcortical networks that subserve at least three broad domains of psychological function linked to psychopathology. One track of research indicates that the vmPFC is critical for the representation of reward- and value-based decision making, through interactions with the ventral striatum and amygdala. A second track of research demonstrates that the vmPFC is critical for the generation and regulation of negative emotion, through its interactions with the amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, periaqueductal gray, hippocampus, and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. A third track of research shows the importance of the vmPFC in multiple aspects of social cognition, such as facial emotion recognition, theory-of-mind ability, and processing self-relevant information, through its interactions with the posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, dorsomedial PFC, and amygdala. We then present meta-analytic data revealing distinct subregions within the vmPFC that correspond to each of these three functions, as well as the associations between these subregions and specific psychiatric disorders (depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, addiction, social anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder). We conclude by describing several translational possibilities for clinical studies of vmPFC-based circuits, including neuropsychological assessment of transdiagnostic functions, anatomical targets for intervention, predictors of treatment response, markers of treatment efficacy, and subtyping within disorders.Copyright © 2017 Society of Biological Psychiatry",Biological Psychiatry,15-Apr-18

Although we made substantial progress in our basic understanding of addiction, reliable therapies are lacking. Since 40-60% of patients treated for substance use disorder return to active substance use within a year following treatment discharge, alleviating the vulnerability to relapse is regarded as the most promising avenue for addiction therapy. Preclinical addiction research often focuses on maladaptive synaptic plasticity within the reward pathway. However, drug induced neuroadaptations do not only lead to a strengthening of distinct drug associated cues and drug conditioned behaviors, but also seem to increase plasticity thresholds for environmental stimuli that are not associated with the drug. This form of higher order plasticity, or synaptic metaplasticity, is not expressed as a change in the efficacy of synaptic transmission but as a change in the direction or degree of plasticity induced by a distinct stimulation pattern. Experimental addiction research has demonstrated metaplasticity after exposure to multiple classes of addictive drugs. In this review we will focus on the concept of synaptic metaplasticity in the context of preclinical addiction research. We will take a closer look at the tetrapartite glutamatergic synapse and outline forms of metaplasticity that have been described at the addicted synapse. Finally we will discuss the different potential avenues for pharmacotherapies that target glutamatergic synaptic plasticity and metaplasticity. Here we will argue that aberrant metaplasticity renders the reward seeking circuitry more rigid and hence less able to adapt to changing environmental contingencies. An understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie this metaplasticity is crucial for the development of new strategies for addiction therapy. The correction of drug-induced metaplasticity could be used to support behavioral and pharmacotherapies for the treatment of addiction.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Neurobiology of Learning and Memory,Oct-18

Inhalants include volatile solvents, fuels, volatile anesthetics, gasses, and liquefied refrigerants, among others. They are ubiquitous in modern society as ingredients in a wide variety of household, commercial, and medical products. Persons of all ages abuse inhalants but the highest prevalence of abuse is in younger adolescents. Although inhalants have been shown to act upon a host of neurotransmitter receptors, the stimulus effects of the few inhalants which have been trained or tested in drug discrimination procedures suggest that their discriminative stimulus properties are mediated by a few key neurotransmitter receptor systems. Abused volatile solvent inhalants have stimulus effects that are similar to a select group of GABAA positive modulators comprised of benzodiazepines and barbiturates. In contrast the stimulus effects of nitrous oxide gas appear to be at least partially mediated by uncompetitive antagonism of NMDA receptors. Finally, volatile anesthetic inhalants have stimulus effects in common with both GABAA positive modulators as well as competitive NMDA antagonists. In addition to a review of the pharmacology underlying the stimulus effects of inhalants, the chapter also discusses the scientific value of utilizing drug discrimination as a means of functionally grouping inhalants according to their abuse-related pharmacological properties.Copyright © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",,2018

transcranial magnetic stimulation","Alcohol use disorder is a complex syndrome with multiple treatment points including drug-induced pathology, withdrawal management, behavioral/cognitive strategies, and relapse prevention. These different components may be complicated by genotype and phenotype. A huge milestone for the treatment of alcohol use disorder across several countries in the last 10 years was the introduction of practice guidelines integrating clinical expertise and research evidence. These provide a summary of interventions that have been shown to be effective following rigorous and replicated clinical trials. Inspection of these guidelines reveals good consistency, but little evidence of progress in treatment approaches for alcohol use disorder over the past decade. In this mini-review, we discuss emerging treatments for alcohol use disorder that may supplement or improve the evidence-based treatments that are currently recommended. New medications, the emergence of digital technology, and other novel approaches such as transcranial magnetic stimulation are all discussed with reference to treatments already in practice. We also consider how individual differences in genotype and phenotype may affect outcomes. Together with improvements in technology, this knowledge offers a powerful tool for designing personalized approaches to treatment, and hence improving prognosis for rehabilitation programs.Copyright © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Psychopharmacology,01-Jun-18

Review

*signal transduction","Alcohol addiction, affecting approximately four percent of the population, contributes significantly to the global burden of diseases and is a substantial cost to the society. The neurochemical mechanisms regulating alcohol mediated behaviors is complex and in more recent years a new physiological role of the gut-brain peptides, traditionally known to regulate appetite and food intake, have been suggested. Indeed, regulators of alcohol-mediated behaviors. One of these gut-brain peptides is the annorexigenic peptide glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), Preclinical studies show that GLP-1 receptor activation, either by GLP-1 or analogues, attenuate the ability of alcohol to activate the mesolimbic dopamine system as well as decrease alcohol consumption and operant self-administration. In further support for the endogenous GLP-1 system in addiction processes are the experimental data showing that a GLP-1 receptor antagonist increases alcohol intake. Moreover, GLP-1 receptor agonists prevent the ability of other addictive drugs to activate the mesolimbic dopamine system. The number of clinical studies is limited, but show i) that genetic variation in the GLP-1 receptor gene is associated with alcohol addiction as well as increased alcohol infusion in humans, ii) that plasma levels of GLP-1 are associated with the subjective experience of cocaine and iii) that a GLP-1 receptor agonist reduces alcohol intake in patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus. These experimental and clinical studies raises the concern that clinically available GLP-1 receptor agonists deserves to be tested as potential treatments of patients with addictive disorders including alcohol addiction.

*transcranial direct current stimulation","Background: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive brain stimulation tool suited to alter cortical excitability and activity via the application of weak direct electrical currents. An increasing number of studies in the addiction literature suggests that tDCS modulates subjective self-reported craving through stimulation of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). The major goal of this study was to explore effects of bilateral DLPFC stimulation on resting state networks (RSNs) in association with drug craving modulation. We targeted three large-scale RSNs; the default mode network (DMN), the executive control network (ECN), and the salience network (SN). Method(s): Fifteen males were recruited after signing written informed consent. We conducted a double-blinded sham-controlled crossover study. Twenty-minute ""real"" and ""sham"" tDCS (2 mA) were applied over the DLPFC on two separate days in random order. Each subject received both stimulation conditions with a 1-week washout period. The anode and cathode electrodes were located over the right and left DLPFC, respectively. Resting state fMRI was acquired before and after real and sham stimulation. Subjective craving was assessed before and after each fMRI scan. The RSNs were identified using seed-based analysis and were compared using a generalized linear model. Result(s): Subjective craving decreased significantly after real tDCS compared to sham stimulation (p =.03). Moreover, the analysis shows significant modulation of DMN, ECN, and SN after real tDCS compared to sham stimulation. Additionally, alteration of subjective craving score was correlated with modified activation of the three networks. Discussion(s): Given the observed alteration of the targeted functional brain networks in methamphetamine users, new potentials are highlighted for tDCS as a network intervention strategy and rsfMRI as a suitable monitoring method for these interventions.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

yoga","Cognitive control (CC)-the ability to regulate attention and memory-plays an important role in a variety of health behaviors, including smoking behavior. In this theoretical review of the literature, we propose a CC and smoking behavior framework that includes (1) the positive influence of CC on the self-regulation of smoking, (2) nicotine-induced improvements in CC that may indirectly reinforce smoking (including withdrawal reversal effects), and (3) the long-term effects of smoking on the brain that may result in reduced CC. Integration of these literatures suggests that CC contributes to both self-regulation (ie, brake pedal) and nicotine-related reinforcement (ie, gas pedal) amid the catastrophic effects of long-term smoking, which may reduce self-regulatory control over smoking while also enhancing indirect reinforcement. Supportive evidence and limitations of this approach will be presented, as well as ideas for future research directions that may fully examine this multifaceted modeling of CC in relation to smoking behavior. Implications: There is substantial evidence that CC contributes to self-regulation (ie, brake pedal) and reinforcement (ie, gas pedal) of smoking behavior as well as evidence that long-term smoking may cause reduced CC. The proposed model delineates how these opposing influences of CC may mask the unique contribution of self-regulation and reinforcement in maintaining smoking behavior. Targeting CC for treating nicotine dependence will require more nuanced approaches that consider the independent and combined effects of self-regulation and reinforcement to improve smoking cessation success rates.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).

Wisconsin Card Sorting Test","Dopaminergic medication can induce severe addictive behaviours (e.g., pathological gambling) in susceptible Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. It is still unknown which particular neurocognitive processes become exacerbated or dysfunctional in PD patients with addictive behaviours. We sought to systematically review the relevant literature to identity potential neurocognitive correlates of medication-induced addictive behaviours in PD. We framed our review around neurocognitive processes central to four dominant accounts of substance addiction: 'aberrant learning' 'incentive sensitization' 'impulsivity to compulsivity' and 'impaired response inhibition and salience attribution'. Searches of the PubMed and Scopus databases were completed on June 23, 2017. To be included, studies were required to involve: (a) medicated PD patients, without a history of deep brain stimulation, with and without addictive behaviours; (b) a reward-related or decision-making task; and (c) statistical comparison of addictive and non-addictive groups' 'on' medication performance on the task(s). Studies were summarised qualitatively with statistically significant (p<.05) group differences and effect sizes (Cohen's d) highlighted. 35 studies were included. Findings showed that the extant literature is highly heterogeneous. The domains of reward and punishment learning, reflection impulsivity and disadvantageous decision-making exemplify this. More homogeneity exists in domains in which (a) neurocognitive dysfunction is not apparent (motor control, cognitive/attentional flexibility and cognitive control) or (b) typical neurocognitive processes appear exacerbated by medication (reward motivation and choice impulsivity). Future large-scale neurocognitive studies are still required to develop our scientific understanding of addictive behaviours in PD and aid their clinical treatment and prediction.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP",European Neuropsychopharmacology,May-18

Dopamine replacement therapy is effective for motor symptoms, but can also lead to motor side-effects and addictive behavior such as impulse control disorders. Molecular imaging is advancing our knowledge of the mechanisms involved in the development of behavioral addictions. This chapter will discuss potential risk factors and associations with the development of addictive behavior in PD including the role of dopaminergic medication and genetic predisposition. We further will describe the common neurobiology and similarities of addictive behavior in PD to addiction, particularly the neuroanatomy of reward processing and its alteration in substance and behavioral addictions. Finally, we will discuss molecular imaging approaches which are helping to delineate the structure as well as the dynamic interactions between different components involving neurotransmitters, transporters, and receptors.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",,2018

*Parkinson disease / *drug therapy / *therapy","We report a 77-year-old man who suffered from Parkinson's disease for 12 years. Four years after the disease onset, he started to show excessive hobbyism of painting. His painting skills improved along with escalating enthusiasm. He even held a personal exhibition of his paintings. Dopaminergic treatment was increased as he developed wearing-off phenomenon. Six years after the disease onset, he developed dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS). In the same year, he underwent surgery for subthalamic deep brain stimulation. DDS did not improve and he did not lose enthusiasm for painting after surgery. Switching from ropinirole to rotigotine improved the DDS, but did not affect the excessive enthusiasm. At the age of 76, he started to have difficulty in completing the paintings. He had an uncontrollable urge to overlay paint strokes until the colors blurred and the paper was torn. In neuropsychological examinations, Mini-Mental State Examination score was above the cutoff, but Frontal Assessment Battery suggested motor perseveration and disinhibition. In summary, the patient's excessive enthusiasm for painting emerged in association with impulse control disorder (ICD) by dopamine agonist therapy, and subsequent change in his painting style appeared to be related with motor perseveration and/or further escalation of ICD.Copyright © 2018 Clinical Neurolog.

While it is not known whether cognitive biases precede or result from addictive behaviour, they likely influence addiction-related decision-making, and may facilitate pathological behaviour. There is evidence that cognitive functions-including those shown to be altered in substance use and addictive disorders-can be influenced by neuromodulation techniques (specifically, transcranial direct current stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation). Much of this work has been conducted in healthy populations, however, making it unclear whether these methods can be used effectively to modulate cognitive functioning in individuals with substance use and addictive disorders. The purpose of the current review is to shed light on the potential effectiveness and feasibility of neuromodulation as a means to improve cognitive deficits in substance use disorders. Method(s): The review will identify and evaluate studies that have examined the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) or transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on cognitive task performance in individuals with chronic substance use or dependence. Relevant studies will be identified through searches in PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Embase, and narrative review will be used to explore evidence that these techniques can be used successfully to modulate cognitive performance in populations exhibiting addictive behaviour. Assessing individual cognitive domains in turn (e.g. risk-taking, impulsivity, attention), we will critically evaluate the validity and reliability of relevant studies and draw conclusions about the strength of evidence for effective use of neuromodulation in that domain. This protocol is not yet registered with PROSPERO. Discussion(s): To determine whether neuromodulation holds promise as an effective treatment for neurocognitive deficits in substance use and addictive disorders, it is essential to look carefully at previous studies using this approach in addiction samples. This review will provide an objective and informative description of what is currently known about the efficacy of these techniques, shed light on the feasibility and potential challenges of using neuromodulation in individuals who exhibit addictive behaviour, and identify the most valuable next steps for future research.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).",Systematic Reviews,26-Jun-18

stress","Drug addiction is a chronic, relapsing brain disorder. Multiple neural networks in the brain including the reward system (e.g., the mesocorticolimbic system), the anti-reward/stress system (e.g., the extended amygdala), and the central immune system, are involved in the development of drug addiction and relapse after withdrawal from drugs of abuse. Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that it is promising to control drug addiction by pharmacologically targeting the addiction-related systems in the brain. Here we review the pharmacological targets within the dopamine system, glutamate system, trace amine system, anti-reward system, and central immune system, which are of clinical interests. Furthermore, we discuss other potential therapies, e.g., brain stimulation, behavioral treatments, and therapeutic gene modulation, which could be effective to treat drug addiction. We conclude that, although drug addiction is a complex disorder that involves complicated neural mechanisms and psychological processes, this mental disorder is treatable and may be curable by therapies such as gene modulation in the future.Copyright © 2018, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, CAS and Chinese Pharmacological Society.

They result from complex interactions between a given individual's predispositions, non-physiological dopaminergic stimulation and PD pathology. Also, sensitization of the mesocorticolimbic pathway, reflected by the psychotropic effects of dopaminergic treatment, plays a crucial role in the emergence of these addictive behaviors. While early detection of changes in behavior, less use of dopamine agonists (DA) that have a relative selectivity for mesocorticolimbic dopamine receptors, and fractionation of levodopa dosages to avoid non-physiological pulsatile stimulation of dopamine receptors are key strategies in the management of this hyperdopaminergic behavioral spectrum, other complementary approaches are also addressed in this review.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS",Revue Neurologique,Nov-18

Research over the past several decades on the neural underpinnings of addiction has implicated a network of structures within the brain shown to be altered in patients with substance abuse. The field of neuromodulation aims to utilize this knowledge to treat dysfunctional circuits by targeting and modulating specific brain circuits. While invasive neuromodulation such as DBS and VNS have proven to be effective in treating movement disorders, OCD and epilepsy, there is increasing interest and data with regards to its potential application for the treatment of severe, intractable addiction. Several neuromodulatory techniques and brain targets are currently under investigation in patients with various substance abuse disorders. This review aims to summarize the current state of evidence for neurosurgical neuromodulation as a therapy for substance abuse and addiction, and to provide additional expert opinions as to the obstacles and future directions of this endeavor.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews,Dec-18

transcranial magnetic stimulation","Neuromodulation therapies such as deep brain stimulation or transcranial magnetic stimulation have shown promise in reducing symptoms of addiction when applied to the prefontal cortex, nucleus accumbens or subthalamic nucleus. Pre-clinical investigations implicate modulation of the cortico-basal ganglia network in these therapeutic effects, and this mechanistic understanding is necessary to optimize stimulation paradigms. Recently, the principle that neuromodulation can reverse drug-evoked synaptic plasticity and reduce behavioral symptoms of addiction has inspired novel stimulation paradigms that have long-term effects in animal models. Pre-clinical studies have also raised the possibility that tailoring neuromodulation protocols can modulate distinct symptoms of addiction. Combining mechanistic knowledge of circuit dysfunction with emerging technologies for non-invasive neuromodulation holds promise for developing therapies for addiction and related disorders.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Current Opinion in Neurobiology,Apr-18

Methods ICDs, including pathological gambling, hypersexuality, compulsive eating and shopping, can occur as a complication of Parkinson's disease (PD) together with other behavioral disorders, including dopamine dysregulation syndrome. This review is based on a literature search updated to May 2017, focusing on the epidemiology, clinical features, and therapeutic options of ICDs associated with PD. Results Studies on the prevalence of ICDs confirm that they represent common phenomena associated with PD, with some centers reporting up to 40% of the PD population affected; the relative prevalence of the main ICDs shows significant variability, with a majority of the studies reporting that hypersexuality is the commonest one. Risk factors associated with the development of ICDs in PD were systematically evaluated, confirming the correlation between these disorders and male gender, younger age at PD onset and family history for addiction. Conclusions We will discuss the recent advances on the functional neuroanatomy, the role of dopamine-serotonin interactions and the cognitive profile associated with ICDs. Management of PD-related ICDs is still based on poor evidence, and this topic should be the object for future researchCopyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Parkinsonism and Related Disorders,Jan-18

treatment response","Purpose of review: Impulsivity is considered a trans-diagnostic feature of many mental disorders, yet our understanding of the concept and approaches to measurement have evolved significantly with advances in neuroimaging. This review will provide an overview of impulsivity as it is currently understood, its association with personality disorder and implications for treatment. Recent findings: Impulsivity is now considered to involve failure of inhibitory control, either motor or cognitive, and deficits of the reward valuation system. Inhibitory control, and discounting of rewards are both independently associated with personality disorder. The tendency to choose immediate rewards over those with an associated delay is a feature of borderline personality disorder (BPD) regardless of conditions of stress. Deficits in response inhibition were also associated with BPD and were worsened under conditions of stress. These findings indicate that state impulsivity has an important role in the expression of impulsive behaviour. Exploratory studies measuring changes in these networks following psychotherapy have confirmed such methods could be used to measuring treatment response. Summary: Understanding the discrete mechanisms of impulsive decision-making and behavior, and their implications in personality disorder, offers new targets for diagnosis and intervention. Future research should aim to understand changes of impulsivity with development. Identifying the role of psychological and pharmacological intervention in modulating the development of impulsivity may prevent progression to personality disorder, and associated adverse outcomes.Copyright © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Now, for the first time, it appears that a noninvasive brain stimulation technique known as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), which is Food and Drug Administration approved to treat depression, may be the first tool available to fill this critical void in addiction treatment development. The goals of this review are to 1) introduce TMS as a tool to induce causal change in behavior, cortical excitability, and frontal-striatal activity; 2) describe repetitive TMS (rTMS) as an interventional tool; 3) provide an overview of the studies that have evaluated rTMS as a therapeutic tool for alcohol and drug use disorders; and 4) outline a conceptual framework for target selection when designing future rTMS clinical trials in substance use disorders. The manuscript concludes with some suggestions for methodological innovation, specifically with regard to combining rTMS with pharmacotherapy as well as cognitive behavioral training paradigms. We have attempted to create a comprehensive manuscript that provides the reader with a basic set of knowledge and an introduction to the primary experimental questions that will likely drive the field of TMS treatment development forward for the next several years.Copyright © 2018 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.",Pharmacological Reviews,01-Jul-18

However, a clear definition of what constitutes innovation is lacking and opinions vary from continent to continent, from hospital to hospital, and from surgeon to surgeon. Method(s): In this study, we distributed an online survey to neurosurgeons from multiple countries to investigate what neurosurgeons consider innovative, by gathering opinions on several hypothetical cases. The anonymous survey consisted of 52 questions and took approximately 10 minutes to complete. Result(s): A total of 355 neurosurgeons across all continents excluding Antarctica completed the survey. Neurosurgeons achieved consensus (>75%) in considering specific cases to be innovative, including laser resection of meningioma, focused ultrasonography for tumor, oncolytic virus, deep brain stimulation for addiction, and photodynamic therapy for tumor. Although the new dura substitute case was not considered innovative, there was consensus among neurosurgeons indicating that institutional review board approval was still necessary to maintain ethical standards. Furthermore, although 90% of neurosurgeons considered an oncolytic virus for glioblastoma multiforme to be innovative, only 78% believed that institutional review board approval was necessary before treatment. Conclusion(s): Our results indicate that innovation is a heterogeneous concept among neurosurgeons that necessitates standardization to ensure appropriate patient safety without stifling progress. We discuss both the ethical drawbacks of not having a clear definition of innovation and the challenges in achieving a unified understanding of innovation in neurosurgery and offer suggestions for uniting the field.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",World Neurosurgery,Jun-18

In a previous study, we showed that five sessions of tDCS applied bilaterally over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) reduced craving to the use of crack-cocaine in inpatients from a specialized clinic. In the present study, we examine if an extended number of sessions of the same intervention would reduce craving even further and affect also relapses to crack-cocaine use. Method(s): A randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, clinical trial with parallel arms was conducted (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02091167). Crack-cocaine patients from two private and one public clinics for treatment of drug use disorder were randomly allocated to two groups: real tDCS (5 cm x 7 cm, 2 mA, for 20 min, cathodal over the left dlPFC and anodal over the right dlPFC, n = 19) and sham-tDCS (n = 16). Real or sham-tDCS was applied once a day, every other day, in a total of 10 sessions. Craving was monitored by a 5-item obsessive compulsive drinking scale once a week (one time before, three times during and once after brain stimulation) over about 5 weeks and relapse was monitored after their discharge from clinics for up to 60 days. Result(s): Craving scores progressively decreased over five measurements in both sham- and real tDCS groups. Corrected Hedges' within-group (initial and final) effect sizes of craving scores were of 0.77 for the sham-tDCS and of 0.97 for the real tDCS group. The between-groups effect size was of 0.34, in favor of the real tDCS group over sham-tDCS group. Relapse rates were high and quite similar between groups in the 30- and 60-days follow-up after discharge from the hospital. Conclusion(s): Extended repetitive bilateral tDCS over the dlPFC had no add-on effects over regular treatment when considering craving and relapses to the crack-cocaine use in a sample of crack-cocaine patients with severe use disorder. Different tDCS montages targeting other cortical regions and perhaps additional extension of sessions need to be investigated to reach more efficiency in managing craving and relapses to crack-cocaine use.Copyright © 2018 Klauss, Anders, Felippe, Ferreira, Cruz, Nitsche and Nakamura-Palacios.",Frontiers in Pharmacology,23-Oct-18

Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale","Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common mental health disorder that occurs at all ages, but more commonly in younger people. It affects 1-1.5% of the general population. Many pharmacological therapies have been reported to diminish OCD symptoms, as well as increase the patient's quality of life. So far, several meta-analyses have directly compared such treatment approaches in treatment-responsive and treatmentresistant OCD. This review evaluated all treatment options for OCD in both children and adolescents, and aimed to establish whether existing pharmacological therapies work similarly well, taking into account medical comorbidities such as substance use, anxiety, metabolic disorders, and finally, an overview of issues related to safety and monitoring. Our review included data from 16 meta-analyses and 8 practical guidelines focusing on OCD patients. In adults with OCD, we found that combined therapy shows favorable outcomes versus SRI alone and produced better results. In children with OCD the greatest incremental treatment gains occur early in treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Finally, in treatment-resistant OCD augmentation of SRIs can be regarded as an evidence-based measure in pharmacological therapy. The results of this review mostly support the previous reviews on the pharmacological management of OCD. However, we noted that combination/augmentation of SSRIs significantly improved symptoms in treatment-resistant OCD compared with monotherapy. From a clinical perspective, antipsychotics combination/augmentation of SSRIs should be used in comorbid psychosis, a frequent comorbidity in OCD, especially as the presence of comorbidities is highly associated with treatment resistance in OCD.Copyright © 2018 Polish Psychiatric Association.All right reserved.",Archives of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy,2018

Where appropriate, treatment is based on reversing the underlying cause of chorea; many cases are self-limited, resolving when the primary disorder is treated. This review focuses on the management of chorea due to untreatable causes. Recent findings: There are a limited number of double-blind randomized control trials assessing the efficacy of specific chorea treatments. Most therapeutic recommendations are based on small open-label studies, case reports, and expert opinion. This is in part due to the heterogeneity of chorea and chorea-associated syndromes and the variety of neurodegenerative phenotypes with variable progression rates. Summary: Chorea can be treated with a variety of medications ranging from antiepileptics to antipsychotics. The recent development of selective vesicular monoamine transporter blocking agents has allowed for targeted chorea management with minimal side effects. Neurosurgical interventions such as deep brain surgery (DBS) and pallidotomy are reserved for medication-refractory chorea. As a symptom of neurodegenerative disease, chorea is only one aspect of the basal ganglia syndromes, and often, a multidisciplinary approach tailored to individual patient needs provides the best management.Copyright © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Current Treatment Options in Neurology,01-Oct-18

Drug addiction is a chronically relapsing disorder, and current pharmacological and behavioral therapies are not fully efficient. Attentional bias (AB) is hypothesized to have a causal contribution to substance abuse, addiction development and, maintenance. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been of increasing interest in the past few years as a means for modulating neuroplasticity of the human brain. Although several studies have reported promising therapeutic effects for tDCS in drug abusers, there is no consensus about optimal electrode montages and target brain regions. This study was aimed to compare effectiveness of several electrode montages in modifying AB. Methods and Materials: Ninety early-abstinent methamphetamine users were recruited from several residential drug-rehabilitation centers in Tehran province. They were randomly assigned to six groups with different electrode montages, targeting the left or right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) as follows: Two conditions with anodal tDCS over the right DLPFC (return electrode placed over the left shoulder or left supraorbital ridge), three conditions with the anode positioned over the left DLPFC (return electrode over the right shoulder, right supraorbital ridge, or contralateral DLPFC), and one sham condition. Active stimulation intensity was 2 mA DC, delivered for 13 min followed by a 20-min rest and another 13 min of stimulation. The probe detection task (PDT) was performed to assess AB. The positive and negative affect scale (PANAS), and the depression anxiety stress scales (DASS) were used to assess baseline affective status before the intervention. Result(s): Mixed model analysis showed that the left DLPFC/right shoulder and left DLPFC/right DLPFC montages reduced AB toward drug-cues in comparison with sham stimulation. Conclusion(s): Our findings indicate that anodal stimulation over the left DLPFC reduces AB in methamphetamine users. This study offers promising findings for further studies investigating tDCS as a clinical device to modify AB in drug users.Copyright © 2018 Shahbabaie, Hatami, Farhoudian, Ekhtiari, Khatibi and Nitsche.",Frontiers in Pharmacology,10-Aug-18

While numerous treatment options are available for AUD, many are unable to sustain long-term sobriety. The nucleus accumbens (NAcc) upholds an integral role in mediating reward behavior and has been implicated as a potential target for deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the context of AUD. DBS is empirically thought to disrupt pathological neuronal synchrony, a hallmark of binge behavior. Pre-clinical animal models and pilot human clinical studies utilizing DBS for the treatment of AUD have shown promise for reducing alcohol-related cravings and prolonging abstinence. In this review, we outline the various interventions available for AUD, and the translational potential DBS has to modulate functionality of the NAcc as a treatment for AUD.Copyright © 2018 by the authors.

serotoninergic nerve cell","The serotonin2B receptor (5-HT2BR), which was first cloned and characterized in the rat stomach fundus, is the most recent addition to the 5-HT2R family. While its involvement in the regulation of gastrointestinal, vascular, pulmonary and cardiac physiology has been widely investigated, its functional role within the central nervous system (CNS) has received much less attention. Nevertheless, when considering the data available in the literature with regards to the regulatory control exerted by the central 5-HT2BR on dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) neuron activity, a very interesting picture emerges and highlights the key role of these receptors for future therapeutic strategies of DA-related neuropsychiatric disorders. Thus, the present review, by compiling molecular, biochemical, electrophysiological and behavioral findings from the literature of the past twenty years, aims at providing a sound analysis of the current knowledge supporting the interest of the central 5-HT2BR for future therapeutic avenues. First, we recall the neuroanatomical and functional data supporting the therapeutic relevance of the 5-HT/DA interaction in the CNS. Thereafter, after a short overview of the central expression and molecular properties of the 5-HT2BR, as well as of the 5-HT2BR agonists and antagonists available in the market, we will focus on the functional role of this receptor in the control of 5-HT, DA and neuroglia activity in the rodent brain. Finally, the therapeutic potential of 5-HT2BR antagonists for improved treatment of schizophrenia and drug addiction will be discussed.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Pharmacology and Therapeutics,Jan-18

treatment response","The treatment of psychiatric diseases with Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is becoming more of a reality as studies proliferate the indications and targets for therapies. Opinions on the initial failures of DBS trials for some psychiatric diseases point to a certain lack of finesse in using an Open Loop DBS (OLDBS) system in these dynamic, cyclical pathologies. OLDBS delivers monomorphic input into dysfunctional brain circuits with modulation of that input via human interface at discrete time points with no interim modulation or adaptation to the changing circuit dynamics. Closed Loop DBS (CLDBS) promises dynamic, intrinsic circuit modulation based on individual physiologic biomarkers of dysfunction. Discussed here are several psychiatric diseases which may be amenable to CLDBS paradigms as the neurophysiologic dysfunction is stochastic and not static. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) has several peripheral and central physiologic and neurologic changes preceding stereotyped hyper-activation behavioral responses. Biomarkers for CLDBS potentially include skin conductance changes indicating changes in the sympathetic nervous system, changes in serum and central neurotransmitter concentrations, and limbic circuit activation. Chemical dependency and addiction have been demonstrated to be improved with both ablation and DBS of the Nucleus Accumbens and as a serendipitous side effect of movement disorder treatment. Potential peripheral biomarkers are similar to those proposed for PTSD with possible use of environmental and geolocation based cues, peripheral signs of physiologic arousal, and individual changes in central circuit patterns. Non-substance addiction disorders have also been serendipitously treated in patients with OLDBS for movement disorders. As more is learned about these behavioral addictions, DBS targets and effectors will be identified. Finally, discussed is the use of facial recognition software to modulate activation of inappropriate responses for psychiatric diseases in which misinterpretation of social cues feature prominently. These include Autism Spectrum Disorder, PTSD, and Schizophrenia-all of which have a common feature of dysfunctional interpretation of facial affective clues. Technological advances and improvements in circuit-based, individual-specific, real-time adaptable modulation, forecast functional neurosurgery treatments for heretofore treatment-resistant behavioral diseases.Copyright © 2018 Bina and Langevin.",Frontiers in Neuroscience,04-May-18

The prevalence of this disorder is low; the condition is more often diagnosed in individuals with a history of previous psychological issues or substance misuse, but it can arise in anyone, even after a single exposure to triggering drugs. The aims of the present study are to review all the original studies about HPPD in order to evaluate the following: (1) the possible suggested etiologies; (2) the possible hallucinogens involved in HPPD induction; (3) the clinical features of both HPPD I and II; (4) the possible psychiatric comorbidities; and (5) the available and potential therapeutic strategies. We searched PubMed to identify original studies about psychedelics and Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder (HPPD). Our research yielded a total of 45 papers, which have been analyzed and tabled to provide readers with the most updated and comprehensive literature review about the clinical features and treatment options for HPPD.Copyright © 2018 by the authors.

One facet of self-control is the ability to forego smaller sooner rewards in favor of larger later rewards (delay discounting, DD). The NAc has been suggested to integrate motivational information to guide behavior while the consequences of NAc-DBS on DD are unknown. To this end, nine patients with SUD performed a DD task with DBS on and after a 24 h DBS off period. Furthermore, 18 healthy controls were measured to assess possible alterations in DD in patients with SUD. Our findings implicate that DD was not significantly modulated by NAc-DBS and also that patients with SUD did not differ from healthy controls. While null results must be interpreted with caution, the commonly observed association of impaired DD in SUD might suggest a long-term effect of NAc-DBS that was not sufficiently modulated by a 24 h DBS off period.Copyright © 2018 by the author.

Questions about neuronal circuitry that had previously been impossible or extremely difficult to test suddenly have become viable experimental questions. Although optogenetics was originally pioneered for use in neurons, it is now clear that systems as diverse as atrial cardiomyocytes, pancreatic islet cells, and tumor cells can be manipulated with this technique. A great many of the studies that employ optogenetics propose that this new technology can be used as therapy for a variety of pathologies. For example, optogenetic strategies in animal models have restored sight to blind rodents, stopped seizures in epileptic animals, and abolished behavioral manifestations of addiction in cocaine-treated mice. It is no surprise, then, that one of the most oft-asked questions is if and when optogenetics can be used as a treatment in the clinic. Will optogenetic technology ever be safe enough to use in human therapies? In this closing chapter, we will briefly review the current state of optogenetic technology in relation to translational efforts, discuss the ethical issues surrounding the use of optogenetics in human patients, and finally examine several lines of experimental evidence that illustrate the potential clinical uses of optogenetics.Copyright © Springer Science+Business Media LLC 2018.",,2018

Dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS) is a complication of the dopaminergic therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD); it is manifested as a compulsive medication use and may have negative impact on patients' social, psychological, and physical functioning. An effect of deep brain stimulation in the subthalamic nucleus (DBS STN) on DDS is not fully understood. Therefore, the degree of DDS during DBS STN in PD patients was evaluated in the study. Material and methods. The main group included 15 patients with DDS symptoms in the preoperative period. The comparison group consisted of 15 patients without DDS symptoms and the control group consisted of 15 patients who did not undergo surgery. Results and conclusion. The severity of motor disturbances in the surgery groups has decreased significantly (by 45%). Motor complications during DBS STN in patients with DDS have decreased by 50%; a decrease in the reduction of doses of dopaminergic preparations was noted as well.Copyright © 2017, Media Sphera Publishing Group.

However, few studies to date have investigated craving in IGD. In the current study, we investigated how gaming was associated with changes in response to gaming-related stimuli in subjects with IGD and those with recreational game use (RGU). Methods Behavioral and functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected from 27 individuals with IGD and 43 individuals with RGU. Subjects' craving responses to gaming-related stimuli were measured before and after 30 minutes of gaming. Results The comparison between post- and pregaming measures showed that for IGD, gaming was associated with increased craving and increased brain activation of the lateral and prefrontal cortex, the striatum, and the precuneus when exposed to gaming-related stimuli. In individuals with RGU, no enhanced brain activity was observed. Conclusions These results suggest that gaming behavior enhances craving responses in subjects with IGD but not in subjects with RGU, provide insight into potential mechanisms underlying IGD, and suggest behavioral and neurobiological targets for IGD-related interventions.Copyright © 2017 Society of Biological Psychiatry",Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging,Jul-17

Multiple conserved vertebrate neural circuits have been discovered that act in a species-specific manner to reinforce behaviors that are rewarding, while attenuating those with an adverse outcome. A growing body of research now suggests that malfunction of the same circuits is an underlying cause for many human disorders and mental ailments. The habenula (Latin for ""little rein"") complex, an epithalamic structure that regulates midbrain monoaminergic activity has emerged in recent years as one such region in the vertebrate brain that modulates behavior. Its dysfunction, on the other hand, is implicated in a spectrum of psychiatric disorders in humans such as schizophrenia, depression and addiction. Here, I review the progress in identification of potential mechanisms involving the habenula in addiction.Copyright © 2017",Seminars in Cell and Developmental Biology,Jun-18

Treatment approaches consist of behavioural and pharmacological approaches, however, these are often found to be ineffective. In severe obesity, bariatric surgery is frequently performed. Unfortunately, 40% of patients show substantial weight gain over the long term or display the associated metabolic syndrome, making the development of novel therapies necessary. This review summarizes some of the current conceptual models, in particularly the 'food addiction' model, and then discusses specific therapeutic targets of brain stimulation, both non-invasive (transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (VNS)) and invasive (deep brain stimulation and invasive VNS). As we will show, neuromodulatory approaches represent a promising tool for targeting specific brain structures implicated in the pathophysiology of obesity. Non-invasive techniques such as TMS, tDCS and transcutaneous VNS need further investigation before they may become ready for clinical usage. The currently available study data suggest that deep brain stimulation may become an effective and acceptable therapy for otherwise treatment-resistant obese patients. The results of the currently undergoing clinical trials are eagerly awaited.Copyright © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

Review","BACKGROUND Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is now used regularly to treat therapy-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorders, and is being applied experimentally for refractory depression, Tourette syndrome, addiction, eating disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, autism and schizophrenia. AIM To review the effects and mechanisms of DBS and to consider the future opportunities for this type of treatment in psychiatry. METHOD We reviewed the literature using PubMed. RESULTS DBS is effective and safe to use in the treatment of therapy-refractory oco and has produced encouraging results in cases of refractory depression and Tourette syndrome. However, further investigations are needed with regard to the use of DBS for treating other psychiatric disorders, DBS influences brain networks that are relevant for a whole range of psychiatric symptoms. CONCLUSION DBS should always be considered as possible treatment for therapy-refractory OCD. DBS often leads to marked and rapid improvement in mood, anxiety, behaviour and other psychiatric symptoms, making it a promising intervention for a variety of refractory patient groups. The development of DBS for psychiatry will benefit from our increased knowledge about how specific brain networks relate to psychiatric dysfunctioning.",Tijdschrift voor Psychiatrie,Oct-17

Sex differences in smoking cue (SC) reactivity may underlie such behavioral differences. However, the influence of sex on brain reactivity to SCs has yielded inconsistent findings suggesting the need for continued study. Here, we investigated the effect of sex on SC reactivity across two sites using different imaging modalities and SC stimulus types. Methods Pseudo-continuous arterial spin-labeled (pCASL) perfusion functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to assess brain responses to SC versus non-SC videos in 40 smokers (23 females) at the University of Pennsylvania. BOLD fMRI was used to assess brain responses to SC versus non-SC still images in 32 smokers (18 females) at McLean Hospital. Brain reactivity to SCs was compared between men and women and was correlated with SC-induced craving. Results In both cohorts, males showed higher SC versus non-SC reactivity compared to females in reward-related brain regions (i.e., ventral striatum/ventral pallidum, ventral medial prefrontal cortex). Brain activation during SC versus non-SC exposure correlated positively with SC-induced subjective craving in males, but not females. Conclusions The current work provides much needed replication and validation of sex differences in SC-reactivity. These findings also add to a body of literature showing that men have greater reward-related brain activation to drug cues across drug classes. Such sex differences confirm the need to consider sex not only when evaluating SC-reactivity but when examining nicotine dependence etiology and treatment.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Drug and Alcohol Dependence,01-Sep-17

As a step towards translating those data to a neural circuit-based intervention for patients, this study sought to determine if continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) to the left frontal pole (FP), would attenuate frontal-striatal activity in two substance-dependent populations. Methods Forty-nine substance dependent individuals (25 cocaine, 24 alcohol) completed a single-blind, sham-controlled, crossover study wherein they received 6 trains of real or sham cTBS (110% resting motor threshold, FP1) each visit. Baseline evoked BOLD signal was measured immediately before and after real and sham cTBS (interleaved TMS/BOLD imaging: single pulses to left FP; scalp-to-cortex distance covariate, FWE correction p < 0.05) Results Among cocaine users, real cTBS significantly decreased evoked BOLD signal in the caudate, accumbens, anterior cingulate, orbitofrontal (OFC) and parietal cortex relative to sham cTBS. Among alcohol users, real cTBS significantly decreased evoked BOLD signal in left OFC, insula, and lateral sensorimotor cortex. There was no significant difference between the groups. Conclusions These data suggest that 6 trains of left FP cTBS delivered in a single day decreases TMS-evoked BOLD signal in the OFC and several cortical nodes which regulate salience and are typically activated by drug cues. The reliability of this pattern across cocaine- and alcohol-dependent individuals suggests that cTBS may be an effective tool to dampen neural circuits typically engaged by salient drug cues. Multiday studies are required to determine it this has a sustainable effect on the brain or drug use behavior.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Drug and Alcohol Dependence,01-Sep-17

ventromedial prefrontal cortex","Major depressive disorder (MDD) and substance use disorders (SUDs) are prevalent, disabling, and challenging illnesses for which new treatment options are needed, particularly in comorbid cases. Neuroimaging studies of the functional architecture of the brain suggest common neural substrates underlying MDD and SUDs. Intrinsic brain activity is organized into a set of functional networks, of which two are particularly relevant to psychiatry. The salience network (SN) is crucial for cognitive control and response inhibition, and deficits in SN function are implicated across a wide variety of psychiatric disorders, including MDD and SUDs. The ventromedial network (VMN) corresponds to the classic reward circuit, and pathological VMN activity for drug cues/negative stimuli is seen in SUDs/MDD. Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques, including rTMS and tDCS, have been used to enhance cortico-striatal-thalamic activity through the core SN nodes in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and anterior insula. Improvements in both MDD and SUD symptoms ensue, including in comorbid cases, via enhanced cognitive control. Inhibition of the VMN also appears promising in preclinical studies for quenching the pathological incentive salience underlying SUDs and MDD. Evolving techniques may further enhance the efficacy of NIBS for MDD and SUD cases that are unresponsive to conventional treatments.Copyright © 2016 The Authors.

Affected patients may benefit from device-assisted therapy, such as medication infusion or deep brain stimulation surgery. This is the first Australian study of the long-term adherence to apomorphine infusion (AI) in patients with PD. Aim(s): To assess the adherence to AI in patients with PD in a single centre over a 10-year period and to find the reasons for discontinuation in patients who discontinued AI. Method(s): This is an observational study of patients with PD treated with AI between 2004 and 2014. Outcome measures included changes in motor function and quality of life following AI, change in dose of other dopaminergic medications following AI, duration of infusion, adverse effects, reasons for cessation of AI and subsequent treatment after cessation. Result(s): Mean duration of AI was 21.65 months. No patient achieved apomorphine monotherapy, and the mean reduction in the levodopa-equivalent dose of other dopaminergic medications after AI was 22.7%. The benefit of AI on motor function and quality of life was rated as 'much improved' or 'better' in 83% of patients. The most common reasons for discontinuation of AI were adverse effects and inadequate motor benefit. Most patients who discontinued AI were subsequently treated with another device-assisted therapy. Conclusion(s): AI is an effective therapy for severe motor response complications in PD, especially in the short and medium term. However, many patients cannot be maintained on AI in the longer term.Copyright © 2017 Royal Australasian College of Physicians",Internal Medicine Journal,May-17

schizophrenia / therapy","Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a last-resort treatment for neurological and psychiatric disorders that are refractory to standard treatment. Over the last decades, the progress of DBS in psychiatry has been slower than in neurology, in part owing to the heterogenic symptomatology and complex neuroanatomy of psychiatric disorders. However, for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) DBS is now an accepted treatment. This study first reviews clinical outcomes and mechanisms of DBS for OCD, and then discusses these results in an overview of current and future psychiatric applications, including DBS for mood disorders, Tourette's syndrome, addiction, anorexia nervosa, autism, schizophrenia, and anxiety disorders. In addition, it will focus on novel techniques that may enhance the application of DBS in psychiatry.Copyright © 2017 The Author(s).

It is recognized as a major physiological basis for adaption of cognition and behaviour, and, thus, of utmost importance for normal brain function. Cognitive dysfunctions are major symptoms in psychiatric disorders, which are often associated with pathological alteration of neuroplasticity. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a recently developed non-invasive brain stimulation technique, is able to induce and modulate cortical plasticity in humans via the application of relatively weak current through the scalp of the head. It has the potential to alter pathological plasticity and restore dysfunctional cognitions in psychiatric diseases. In the last decades, its efficacy to treat psychiatric disorders has been explored increasingly. This review will give an overview of pathological alterations of plasticity in psychiatric diseases, gather clinical studies involving tDCS to ameliorate symptoms, and discuss future directions of application, with an emphasis on optimizing stimulation effects.Copyright © 2017 Institute of Psychiatry and Johns Hopkins University.",International Review of Psychiatry,04-Mar-17

vivid dream","Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a brain disorder, characterized by the dream enactment during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep due to a lack of physiologic muscle atonia and increased muscle twitching. Schenk was the first to describe this disorder in 1986; however, few authors reported in the 1970-1980s loss of physiological muscle atonia combined with dream enactment in the course of brainstem disorders and as a consequence of alcoholism and antidepressant treatment. RBD affects less than 1% of the adult population, but can be found in up to 25-50% of neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's disease, multisystem atrophy, and dementia with Lewy body. In the last decade, many studies provided evidence that RBD precedes parkinsonian motor signs by several years, suggesting that RBD should no longer be considered a complication but a part of the prodromal phase of these diseases. Etiologically, primary (idiopathic RBD) and several secondary forms in addition to neurodegeneration (related to focal brainstem damage, narcolepsy, autoimmune disorders, and drugs) are known. Pathophysiologically, brainstem and supratentorial mechanisms involving glutamatergic, glycinergic, and GABA-ergic neurotransmission have been implicated. Recently, an animal model of RBD has been described. Clinical features consist of characteristic nocturnal behaviors, but also daytime symptoms including excessive sleepiness and cognitive alterations. The diagnosis of RBD is made according to international diagnostic criteria, based on medical history, and video-polysomnographic features. Current treatment strategies include actions which ensure a safe sleep environment, the avoidance of triggering/exacerbating factors and if necessary pharmacological (mainly clonazepam and melatonin) and non-pharmacological (e.g., behavioral measures) interventions. Future research should clarify the exact sleep-wake characteristics of RBD (also beyond REM sleep) and their evolution over time, the contribution of brainstem but also supratentorial mechanisms to its pathophysiology, and the (early?) diagnostic and (causative?) treatment consequences of RBD in the context of neurodegeneration.Copyright © 2018 S.

Here we focus on insights into the organization and function of reward circuitry and its synaptic and structural adaptations in response to cocaine exposure. While the importance of certain circuits, such as the mesocorticolimbic dopamine pathway, are well established in drug reward, recent studies using genetics-based tools have revealed functional changes throughout the reward circuitry that contribute to different facets of addiction, such as relapse and craving. The ability to observe and manipulate neuronal activity within specific cell types and circuits has led to new insight into not only the basic connections between brain regions, but also the molecular changes within these specific microcircuits, such as neurotrophic factor and GTPase signaling or alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor function, that underlie synaptic and structural plasticity evoked by drugs of abuse. Excitingly, these insights from preclinical rodent work are now being translated into the clinic, where transcranial magnetic simulation and deep brain stimulation therapies are being piloted in human cocaine dependence. Thus, this review seeks to summarize current understanding of the major brain regions implicated in drug-related behaviors and the molecular mechanisms that contribute to altered connectivity between these regions, with the postulation that increased knowledge of the plasticity within the drug reward circuit will lead to new and improved treatments for addiction.Copyright © 2017, The American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics, Inc.",Neurotherapeutics,01-Jul-17

tail suspension test","The forced swim test (FST) measures coping strategy to an acute inescapable stress and thus provides unique insight into the neural limb of the stress response. Stress, particularly chronic stress, is a contributing factor to depression in humans and depression is associated with altered response to stress. In addition, drugs that are effective antidepressants in humans typically promote active coping strategy in the FST. As a consequence, passive coping in the FST has become loosely equated with depression and is often referred to as ""depression-like"" behavior. This terminology oversimplifies complex biology and misrepresents both the utility and limitations of the FST. The FST provides little construct- or face-validity to support an interpretation as ""depression-like"" behavior. While stress coping and the FST are arguably relevant to depression, there are likely many factors that can influence stress coping strategy. Importantly, there are other neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by altered responses to stress and difficulty in adapting to change. One of these is autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and several mouse genetic models of ASD exhibit altered stress-coping strategies in the FST. Here we review evidence that argues a more thoughtful consideration of the FST, and more precise terminology, would benefit the study of stress and disorders characterized by altered response to stress, which include but are not limited to depression.Copyright © 2017 American Chemical Society.",ACS Chemical Neuroscience,17-May-17

relapse","Agonist-replacement therapies have been successfully used for treatment of opiate and nicotine addiction, but not for cocaine addiction. One of the major obstacles is the cocaine-like addictive potential of the agonists themselves. We report here an atypical dopamine (DA) transporter (DAT) inhibitor, CTDP-32476, that may have translational potential for treating cocaine addiction. In vitro ligand-binding assays suggest that CTDP-32476 is a potent and selective DAT inhibitor and a competitive inhibitor of cocaine binding to the DAT. Systemic administration of CTDP-32476 alone produced a slow-onset, long-lasting increase in extracellular nucleus accumbens DA, locomotion, and brain-stimulation reward. Drug-naive rats did not self-Administer CTDP-32476. In a substitution test, cocaine self-Administration rats displayed a progressive reduction in CTDP-32476 self-Administration with an extinction pattern of drug-Taking behavior, suggesting significantly lower addictive potential than cocaine. Pretreatment with CTDP-32476 inhibited cocaine self-Administration, cocaine-Associated cue-induced relapse to drug seeking, and cocaine-enhanced extracellular DA in the nucleus accumbens. These findings suggest that CTDP-32476 is a unique DAT inhibitor that not only could satisfy 'drug hunger' through its slow-onset long-lasting DAT inhibitor action, but also render subsequent administration of cocaine ineffectual-thus constituting a novel and unique compound with translational potential as an agonist therapy for treatment of cocaine addiction.Copyright © 2017 The Author(s).",Neuropsychopharmacology,01-Feb-17

A correlation has been observed between dopamine agonist medication and the development of pathological gambling. However, scientists conjecture that the affected patients have underlying risk factors. Studies analysing Parkinson's patients have detected that patients who developed pathological gambling are younger, score higher on novelty-seeking tests, are more impulsive and are more likely to have a personal or family history of alcohol addiction. In addition, some genetic variations have been associated with the susceptibility of developing pathological gambling, which include mutations of DRD3, 5-HTTLPR and GRIN2B. Studies focusing on neurofunctional discrepancies between Parkinson's patients with and without pathological gambling have found increased functional activation and dopamine release in regions associated with the mesolimbic reward system. Furthermore, there is also evidence showing increased processing of reward and decreased activation elicited by punishment, suggesting altered learning processes. Furthermore, the role of deep brain stimulation of the nucleus subthalamicus (STN DBS) is controversial. In most Parkinson's patients, pathological gambling resolved after the initiation of the STN DBS, which might be explained by discontinuation or decrease in dopamine agonist medication. However, it has been also shown that some patients are more impulsive while the STN DBS is activated. These differences may depend on the DBS localization in the more limbic or motor part of the STN and their regulative effects on impulsivity. Further research is needed to clarify susceptibility factors for the development of pathological gambling in Parkinson's patients.Copyright © 2016 The Authors.

Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is relatively safe and is becoming an emerging therapeutic tool for these conditions. Method(s): This systematic review was conducted using PubMed, PsycINFO, PsychiatryOnline and Cochrane Library ranging from year 2001 to 2017. Result(s): Our search selected 70 related articles of which, based on the Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy (SORT) guidelines, 11 indicated Level-1 study quality and class-B strength of recommendation for rTMS in nicotine addiction (effective in 218/289 subjects who received rTMS as found in 11 studies). Level-2/Class-B evidence was found for alcohol and cocaine addictions (Alco-hol: effective in 126/193 subjects who received rTMS as found in 8 studies; Cocaine: effective in 86/128 subjects, as found in 5 studies). For food cravings, Level-3/Class-B evidence was noted (ef-fective in 134/169, found in 7 studies). However, the evidence was limited to Level-3/Class-C for heroin (10/20 subjects received active rTMS, effective in 1 study), methamphetamine (33/48 subjects received active rTMS, effective in 2 studies), cannabis (18/18 subjects received active rTMS, effective in 1 study), and pathological gambling (31/31 subjects received active rTMS, effective in 2 studies). Conclusion(s): rTMS may serve as an emerging therapeutic option for addiction and related disorders. The major lacunae include important methodological limitations and dearth of knowledge about precise mechanism of action that need to be addressed in the future studies.Copyright © 2017 Bentham Science Publishers.",Current Drug Abuse Reviews,2017

translational research","The habenula is an epithalamic structure located at the center of the dorsal diencephalic conduction system, a pathway involved in linking forebrain to midbrain regions. Composed of a medial and lateral subdivisions, the habenula receives inputs from the limbic system and basal ganglia mainly through the stria medullaris (SM), and projects to midbrain regions through the fasciculus retroflexus (FR). An increasing number of studies have implicated this structure in psychiatric disorders associated with dysregulated reward circuitry function, notably mood disorders, schizophrenia, and substance use disorder. However, despite significant progress in research, the mechanisms underlying the relationship between the habenula and the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders are far from being fully understood, and still need further investigation. This review provides a closer look at key findings from animal and human studies illustrating the role of the habenula in mood disorders, schizophrenia, and substance use disorder, and discusses the clinical potential of using this structure as a therapeutic target.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews,Dec-17

Related behaviors include punding (stereotyped, repetitive, purposeless behaviors), dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS) (compulsive medication overuse), and hobbyism (e.g., compulsive internet use, artistic endeavors, and writing). These disorders have a significant impact on quality of life and function, strain interpersonal relationships, and worsen caregiver burden, and are associated with significant psychiatric comorbidity. ICDs have been most closely related to the use of dopamine agonists (DAs), while DDS is primarily associated with shorter acting, higher potency dopamine replacement therapy (DRT), such as levodopa. However, in preliminary research ICDs have also been reported to occur with monoamine oxidase inhibitor-B and amantadine treatment, and after deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery. Other risk factors for ICDs may include sex (e.g., male sex for compulsive sexual behavior, and female sex for compulsive buying behavior); younger age overall at PD onset; a pre-PD history of an ICD; personal or family history of substance abuse, bipolar disorder, or gambling problems; and impulsive personality traits. Dysregulation of the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system is thought to be the major neurobiological substrate for ICDs in PD, but there is preliminary evidence for alterations in opiate and serotonin systems too. The primary treatment of ICDs in PD is discontinuation of the offending treatment, but not all patients can tolerate this due to worsening motor symptoms or DA withdrawal syndrome. While psychiatric medications and psychosocial treatments are frequently used to treat ICDs in the general population, there is limited empirical evidence for their use in PD, so it is critical for patients to be monitored closely for ICDs from disease onset and routine throughout its course. In the future, it may be possible to use a precision medicine approach to decrease the incidence of ICDs in PD by avoiding DA use in patients determined to be at highest risk based on their clinical and neurobiological (e.g., motor presentation, behavioral measures of medication response, genetics, dopamine transporter neuroimaging) profile. Additionally, as empirically validated treatments for ICDs and similar disorders (e.g., substance use disorders) emerge, it will also be important to examine their efficacy and tolerability in individuals with comorbid PD.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",,2017

Among these are neuroleptic malignant syndrome, serotonin syndrome, dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome, and dystonic storm. It is important to maintain a high index of suspicion for these disorders as lack of identification can lead to death. Many of these acutely occurring nonmotor syndromes are primarily the result of imbalances in dopaminergic and serotonergic systems due to changes in pharmacologic management of psychiatric disorders or Parkinson's disease. We discuss these acutely occurring nonmotor symptoms in order to raise awareness and also to highlight how these extremes in symptoms may uniquely shed light on the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",,2017

systematic review","Objectives Dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS) is an uncommon complication of the treatment of Parkinson's disease, characterised by addictive behaviour and excessive use of dopaminergic medication. DDS may frequently go unrecognised or misdiagnosed. We aimed to clarify current understanding of presentation, risk factors, comorbidities and management of DDS. Methods Case reports were identified through a systematic search of databases (PubMed, Embase) with the following terms: dopaminergic dysregulation syndrome, hedonistic homeostatic dysregulation, dopamine/levodopa addiction. Results We reviewed 390 articles, identifying 98 cases of DDS. Early-onset Parkinson's disease (67%) and male gender (83%) were common. DDS presented with significant physical and social impairment, actions to enable or prevent detection of overuse, as well as mood, anxiety and motor fluctuations. All DDS cases met DSM-V (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition) substance use disorder criteria. Past substance and psychiatric history was present in 15.3% and 10.2% of cases. Comorbid impulse control disorders (61%), psychosis (32%) and panic attacks (14%) were common. A large variety of management strategies were used; only 56% of cases resolving. Sodium valproate was successful in 5/5 cases. The response to deep brain stimulation varied. Conclusions Given the functional impairment, medical and psychiatric consequences and the difficulties of treatment, early identification of DDS should be a priority.Copyright © 2017 Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article).

In this study, EEG was performed in 20 abstinent heroin addicts (AHAs) and 20 age-, education- and gender-matched healthy controls (HCs) while they participated in a simple two-choice gambling task (99 vs. 9). Our behavioral results showed that AHAs tend to select higher-risk choices compared with HCs (i.e., more ""99"" choices than ""9""). ERP results showed that right hemisphere preponderance of stimulus-preceding negativity was disrupted in AHAs, but not in HCs. Feedback-related negativity of difference wave was higher in AHAs than HCs, with the P300 amplitude associated with risk magnitude and valence. Using source localization that allows identification of abnormal brain activity in consequential cognitive stages, including the reward expectation and outcome evaluation stages, we found abnormalities in both behavioral and neural responses on gambling in AHAs. Taken together, our findings suggest AHAs have risk-prone tendency and dysfunction in adaptive decision making, since they continue to choose risky options even after accruing considerable negative scores, and fail to shift to a safer strategy to avoid risk. Such abnormal decision-making bias to risk and immediate reward seeking may be accompanied by abnormal reward expectation and evaluation in AHAs, which explains their high risk-seeking and impulsivity.Copyright © 2017 Zhao, Li, Hu, Wu and Liu.",Frontiers in Neuroscience,06-Dec-17

voxel based morphometry","Corticostriatal circuits through the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) play key roles in complex human behaviors such as evaluation, affect regulation and reward-based decisionmaking. Importantly, the medial and lateral OFC (mOFC and lOFC) circuits have functionally and anatomically distinct connectivity profiles which differentially contribute to the various aspects of goal-directed behavior. OFC corticostriatal circuits have been consistently implicated across a wide range of psychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and substance use disorders (SUDs). Furthermore, psychiatric disorders related to OFC corticostriatal dysfunction can be addressed via conventional and novel neurostimulatory techniques, including deep brain stimulation (DBS), electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Such techniques elicit changes in OFC corticostriatal activity, resulting in changes in clinical symptomatology. Here we review the available literature regarding how disturbances in mOFC and lOFC corticostriatal functioning may lead to psychiatric symptomatology in the aforementioned disorders, and how psychiatric treatments may exert their therapeutic effect by rectifying abnormal OFC corticostriatal activity. First, we review the role of OFC corticostriatal circuits in reward-guided learning, decision-making, affect regulation and reappraisal. Second, we discuss the role of OFC corticostriatal circuit dysfunction across a wide range of psychiatric disorders. Third, we review available evidence that the therapeutic mechanisms of various neuromodulation techniques may directly involve rectifying abnormal activity in mOFC and lOFC corticostriatal circuits. Finally, we examine the potential of future applications of therapeutic brain stimulation targeted at OFC circuitry; specifically, the role of OFC brain stimulation in the growing field of individually-tailored therapies and personalized medicine in psychiatry.Copyright © 2017 Fettes, Schulze and Downar.",Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience,27-Apr-17

An accumulating body of evidence supports the extension of DBS application for the treatment of refractory psychiatric disorders. The ventral capsule/ventral striatum (VC/VS) is the most common anatomical target for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), addiction, and depression. However, no specific electrode is available for the clinical targeting of these areas for DBS. According to the anatomical features of the VC/VS, a novel electrode was developed for simultaneous and independently programmed stimulation of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC). This VC/VS-specific electrode has the potential to enhance stimulus intensity, provide independent and flexible target stimulation.Copyright © 2017 Annals of Translational Medicine.",Annals of Translational Medicine,Oct-17

transcranial magnetic stimulation","The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is the most frequently targeted brain region by noninvasive brain stimulation (NBS) studies. Non-invasively stimulating the PFC has been shown to both modulate affective processing and improve the clinical symptoms of several psychiatric disorders, such as depression and schizophrenia. The magnitude of the modulation depends on several factors, including the stimulation frequency, the number of stimulation sessions, and the specific sub-region of the PFC that is stimulated. Although some of the potential underlying mechanisms have been identified, the exact mechanisms that underlie these cognitive and affective changes remain unclear. The present review aims to summarize recent advances in the study of affective processing using NBS over the PFC. We will provide a theoretical framework for better understanding how affective processing changes are induced by NBS, with the goal of providing testable hypotheses for future studies.Copyright © 2017 Liu, Leng, Zou, Cheng, Yang and Li.",Frontiers in Human Neuroscience,04-Sep-17

The mechanism of this effect however, remains unclear. We used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) to test the effect of rTMS in non-treatment seeking smokers. Methods We used a single blinded, sham-controlled, randomized counterbalanced crossover design where participants underwent two visits separated by at least 1 week. Participants received active rTMS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) during one of their visits, and sham rTMS during their other visit. They had two rsFMRI scans before and after each rTMS session. We used the same rTMS stimulation parameters as in a previous study (10 Hz, 5 s-on, 10 s-off, 100% resting motor threshold, 3000 pulses). Results Ten non-treatment-seeking, nicotine-dependent, cigarette smokers (6 women, an average age of 39.72 and an average cigarette per day of 17.30) finished the study. rsFMRI results demonstrate that as compared to a single session of sham rTMS, a single session of active rTMS inhibits brain activity in the right insula and thalamus in fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (fALFF). For intrinsic brain connectivity comparisons, active TMS resulted in significantly decreased connectivity from the site of rTMS to the left orbitomedial prefrontal cortex. Conclusions This data suggests that one session of rTMS can reduce activity in the right insula and right thalamus as measured by fALFF. The data also demonstrates that rTMS can reduce rsFC between the left DLPFC and the medial orbitofrontal cortex.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Drug and Alcohol Dependence,01-May-17

For this 2016 revision, we performed a systematic review (MEDLINE/PUBMED database, Cochrane Library) of all available publications pertaining to the biological treatment of alcoholism and extracted data from national guidelines. The Task Force evaluated the identified literature with respect to the strength of evidence for the efficacy of each medication and subsequently categorised it into six levels of evidence (A-F) and five levels of recommendation (1-5). Thus, the current guidelines provide a clinically and scientifically relevant, evidence-based update of our earlier recommendations. These guidelines are intended for use by clinicians and practitioners who evaluate and treat people with alcohol use disorders and are primarily concerned with the biological treatment of adults with such disorders.Copyright © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",World Journal of Biological Psychiatry,17-Feb-17

Review","Marijuana use during adolescence has reached virtually every strata of society. The general population has the perception that marijuana use is safe for mature people and therefore is also safe for developing adolescents. However, both clinical and preclinical research shows that marijuana use, particularly prior to age 16, could have long-term effects on cognition, anxiety and stress-related behaviors, mood disorders and substance abuse. These effects derive from the role of the endocannabinoid system, the endogenous cannabinoid system, in the development of cortex, amygdala, hippocampus and hypothalamus during adolescence. Endocannabinoids are necessary for normal neuronal excitation and inhibition through actions at glutamate and GABA terminals. Synaptic pruning at excitatory synapses and sparing of inhibitory synapses likely results in changes in the balance of excitation/inhibition in individual neurons and within networks; processes which are necessary for normal cortical development. The interaction between prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala and hippocampus is responsible for emotional memory, anxiety-related behaviors and drug abuse and all utilize the endogenous cannabinoid system to maintain homeostasis. Also, endocannabinoids are required for fast and slow feedback in the normal stress response, processes which mature during adolescence. Therefore, exogenous cannabinoids, such as marijuana, have the potential to alter the course of development of each of these major systems (limbic, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and neocortex) if used during the critical period of brain development, adolescence.

schizophrenia spectrum disorder

substance abuse","A recently proposed hyperfocusing hypothesis of cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia proposes that people with schizophrenia (PSZ) tend to concentrate processing resources more narrowly but more intensely than healthy control subjects (HCS). The present study tests a key prediction of this hypothesis, namely, that PSZ will hyperfocus on information presented at the center of gaze. This should lead to greater filtering of peripheral stimuli when the task requires focusing centrally but reduced filtering of central stimuli when the task requires attending broadly in the periphery. These predictions were tested in a double oddball paradigm, in which frequent standard stimuli and rare oddball stimuli were presented at central and peripheral locations while event-related potentials were recorded. Participants were instructed to discriminate between the standard and oddball stimuli at either the central location or at the peripheral locations. PSZ and HCS showed opposite patterns of spatial bias at the level of early sensory processing, as assessed with the P1 component: PSZ exhibited stronger sensory suppression of peripheral stimuli when the task required attending narrowly to the central location, whereas HCS exhibited stronger sensory suppression of central stimuli when the task required attending broadly to the peripheral locations. Moreover, PSZ exhibited a stronger stimulus categorization response than HCS, as assessed with the P3b component, for central stimuli when the task required attending to the peripheral region. These results provide strong evidence of hyperfocusing in PSZ, which may provide a unified mechanistic account of multiple aspects of cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia.Copyright © 2017 the authors.",Journal of Neuroscience,05-Apr-17

A systematic review and critical analysis was performed to identify potential therapeutic effects of NIBS on addictions. A search of the Medline database was conducted for randomized sham-controlled trials using NIBS in the field of addiction and published until August 2016. Twenty-six studies in various SUD met the inclusion criteria. Converging evidence indicates that NIBS might be a promising mean to treat patients with alcohol and tobacco use disorders, by acting on craving reduction and other mechanisms such as improvement in cognitive dysfunctions.Copyright © 2017, American Psychiatric Association.

Modern psychosurgery is a viable option in these patients. Also the history of psychosurgery is very interesting and still influencing public perception nowadays. Objective(s): The surgery aim to improve disabling symptoms of patients with minimal complications. Material(s) and Method(s): Medical literatures were reviewed by the authors regarding history, surgical procedures and results. Result(s): Once almost extinct, psychosurgery now becomes more important therapeutic role for treatment of psychiatric diseases. Improved neurosurgical techniques led to significant drop in morbidity and mortality. Although not perfect, better understanding of pathophysiology also led to more precise target for therapy with hopefully more efficacy. Recently, there is trend toward reversible neuromodulation instead of ablative procedures. For psychiatric diseases, such as obsessive compulsive disease and major depressive disorder, substantial numbers of patients fail combination of standard treatments: drugs, psychotherapy and electroconvulsive therapy which have grave prognosis. The need for effective therapy and advanced in knowledge in this field will lead to expanded use of psychosurgery in the near future. Conclusion(s): History of psychosurgery is reviewed. Principle of pathophysiology, patient selection processes and perioperative management are described. Surgical procedures both ablative surgery and neuromodulation are demonstrated as well.Copyright © 2017, Medical Association of Thailand.

It suggests that insights can be gained by looking at the biopsychological processes that underlie 'conventional behavior'. It argues that sexual violence, as in rape, arises from a fusion between (i) sexual motivation and (ii) sensation-seeking and varying strengths of dominance/aggression motivations. The excitatory part of the motivational system is rooted in brain dopamine and sexual violence is expressed in behavior when excitation exceeds inhibition. The assumptions are framed within the principle of the hierarchical control of behavior. The incentive-motivation and hierarchical framework can yield insights into such phenomena as planning and impulsivity, future discounting, habituation and escalation, violence as addiction, the role of fetishes, sexual fantasy, stress, drugs and brain development.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Aggression and Violent Behavior,May-17

support group","Any type of behavioral change is an effortful process. Thus, the process of behavioral therapy, where clients seek to change maladaptive behavioral patterns, requires high-level cognitive engagement. It is unfortunate, then, that cognitive impairment is a feature of substance use disorders (SUDs), and especially because the domains that tend to be impaired are the very ones involved in the process of therapeutic behavioral change. In this review, we compare the cognitive profile that is frequently observed with chronic SUD with the skills that are required to initiate and sustain behavioral change during rehabilitation. Furthermore, we look to new therapeutic developments that seek to improve cognitive function. We propose that the use of these cognitive enhancing agents as adjuncts to behavioral therapy should help to overcome some of the cognitive barriers imposed by the disorder itself, and hence reduce the chance of relapse.Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and International Behavioural and Neural Genetics Society","Genes, Brain and Behavior",01-Jan-17

Use of closed-loop technology will make both DBS and DBM more precise as procedures and will broaden their indications. CLDBS utilizes as feedback a variety of sources of electrophysiological and neurochemical afferent information about the function of the brain structures to be treated or studied. The efferent actions will be either electric, i.e. the classic excitatory or inhibitory ones, or micro-injection of such things as neural proteins and transmitters, neural grafts, implants of pluripotent stem cells or mesenchymal stem cells, and some variants of gene therapy. The pathologies to be treated, beside Parkinson's disease and movement disorders, include repair of neural tissues, neurodegenerative pathologies, psychiatric and behavioral dysfunctions, i.e. schizophrenia in its various guises, bipolar disorders, obesity, anorexia, drug addiction, and alcoholism. The possibility of using these new modalities to treat a number of cognitive dysfunctions is also under consideration. Because the DBS-CLDBS technology brings about a cross-fertilization between scientific investigation and surgical practice, it will also contribute to an enhanced understanding of brain function.Copyright © 2017",Metabolism: Clinical and Experimental,01-Apr-17

treatment response","Objective: Electrical stimulation via implanted electrodes that overlie the cortex of the brain is an upcoming neurosurgical technique that was hindered for a long time by insufficient knowledge of how the brain functions in a dynamic, physiological, and pathological way, as well as by technological limitations of the implantable stimulation devices. Method(s): This paper provides an overview of cortex stimulation via implantable devices and introduces future possibilities to improve cortex stimulation. Result(s): Cortex stimulation was initially used preoperatively as a technique to localize functions in the brain and only later evolved into a treatment technique. It was first used for pain, but more recently a multitude of pathologies are being targeted by cortex stimulation. These disorders are being treated by stimulating different cortical areas of the brain. Risks and complications are essentially similar to those related to deep brain stimulation and predominantly include haemorrhage, seizures, infection, and hardware failures. For cortex stimulation to fully mature, further technological development is required to predict its outcomes and improve stimulation designs. This includes the development of network science-based functional connectivity approaches, genetic analyses, development of navigated high definition transcranial alternating current stimulation, and development of pseudorandom stimulation designs for preventing habituation. Conclusion(s): In conclusion, cortex stimulation is a nascent but very promising approach to treating a variety of diseases, but requires further technological development for predicting outcomes, such as network science based functional connectivity approaches, genetic analyses, development of navigated transcranial electrical stimulation, and development of pseudorandom stimulation designs for preventing habituation.Copyright © 2017 International Neuromodulation Society",Neuromodulation,01-Apr-17

substance use","Bipolar disorder as it is currently treated in the community and in academic settings is associated with a surprisingly high-degree morbidity and treatment resistance. While some of this poor outcome may be due to inherent difficulties of the illness itself, much of the difficulty appears attributable to less than optimal pharmacotherapeutic approaches and patient education about the illness. We emphasize the conceptualization of the illness progressing in an untoward direction, driven by several types of sensitization mechanisms, each involving epigenetic changes. Epigenetics refers to environmentally-induced chemical changes in DNA, histones, and micro RNAstructure and function which endure in a long-lasting fashion. This potential for accumulating epigenetic marks from recurrent stressors, episodes and bouts of substance abuse speaks to the importance of early and consistent long term pharmacoprophylaxis starting after a first episode of mania in order to prevent illness progression. We review the emerging evidence for a new recommendation for ultraintensive treat-ment after a first manic episode and the wealth of data indicating the importance of having lithium involved in the treatment regimen. Problems of bipolar illness morbidity and treatment resistance are particularly pronounced in the United States (USA). Compared to many European countries, bipolar illness in the USAappears to have an earlier age of onset, run a more difficult course, and have more psychiatric and medical comorbidities. This greater complexity of illness typically requires not monotherapy as is often recommended, but complex combination therapy with multiple medications targeting multiple symptoms and pathways. If instituted judiciously, the use of more medications can lead not only to better efficacy, but also, contrary to convention wisdom, fewer side effects. It is hoped that reconceptualization of bipolar illness as a progressive one that can undergo malignant transformation if not adequately treated will help lead to revisions in conventional treatment practices that will render the illness more benign it its long-Term outcome.Copyright © 2017 edizioni minerva medica.",Minerva Psichiatrica,Mar-17

The present study was conducted to discuss the incidence, prevention, and treatment of symptomatic ICH after DBS surgery. Method(s): From January 2009 to December 2014, 396 patients underwent DBS with a total of 691 implanted leads. In all, 10 patients had symptomatic ICH. We analyzed these cases' clinical characteristics, including comorbid diagnoses and coagulation profile. We described the onset of ICH, imaging features, clinical manifestations, treatment, neurological impairment, and outcome of DBS. Result(s): Of the 10 patients with symptomatic ICH, 2 had hypertension. Three cases of ICH occurred within 12 h of the procedure; four cases within 24 h. Five experienced grand mal seizures concurrently with hemorrhage. Unilateral frontal lobe hemorrhage occurred in all cases. In seven cases, hematomas occurred around the electrodes. Some hematomas were not well-circumscribed and had perihematomal edema. Conservative therapy was administered to 8 patients, and 2 patients underwent craniotomy and hematoma evacuation. All electrodes were successfully preserved. Neurological dysfunction in all patients gradually improved. Nine patients ultimately experienced effective symptom relief of Parkinson's disease with DBS. Conclusion(s): Symptomatic ICH should be identified as soon as possible after implantation surgery and treated effectively to limit neurological deficit and preserve DBS leads.Copyright © 2016 The Neurosurgical Foundation.",British Journal of Neurosurgery,04-Mar-17

The purpose of this study was present a case series of ISA in patients with movement disorders. Method(s): Fifteen patients with different forms of movement disorders (Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Tourette's syndrome, spinocerebellar ataxia type 3), were evaluated in the Movement Disorders Unit of the Federal University of Parana. Result(s): Among Parkinson's disease patients there were seven cases with different forms of ISA due to dopaminergic agonist use, levodopa abuse, and deep brain stimulation (DBS). In the group with hyperkinetic disorders, two patients with Huntington's disease, two with Tourette's syndrome, and four with spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 presented with ISA. Conclusion(s): ISA in this group of patients had different etiologies, predominantly related to dopaminergic treatment or DBS in Parkinson's disease, part of the background clinical picture in Huntington's disease and Tourette's syndrome, and probably associated with cultural aspects in patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 3.Copyright © 2016, Associacao Arquivos de Neuro-Psiquiatria.

Rather than a single unifying mechanism, DBS likely acts via several, nonexclusive mechanisms including local and network-wide electrical and neurochemical effects of stimulation, modulation of oscillatory activity, synaptic plasticity, and, potentially, neuroprotection and neurogenesis. These different mechanisms vary in importance depending on the condition being treated and the target being stimulated. Here we review each of these in turn and illustrate how an understanding of these mechanisms is inspiring next-generation approaches to DBS.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.",Journal of Neurophysiology,08-Jan-16

The Think Tank discussions first focused on policy and advocacy in DBS research and clinical practice, formation of registries, and issues involving the use of DBS in the treatment of Tourette Syndrome. Next, advances in the use of neuroimaging and electrochemical markers to enhance DBS specificity were addressed. Updates on ongoing use and developments of DBS for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, Alzheimer's disease, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, obesity, addiction were presented, and progress toward innovation(s) in closed-loop applications were discussed. Each section of these proceedings provides updates and highlights of new information as presented at this year's international Think Tank, with a view toward current and near future advancement of the field.Copyright © 2016 Deeb.",Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience,22-Nov-16

For increased social network use, a few existing studies suggest striatal-related positive social feedback as an underlying factor. However, whether an impaired self-concept and its reward-based compensation through the online presentation of an idealized version of the self are related to pathological social network use has not been investigated yet. We aimed to compare different stages of pathological Internet game and social network use to explore the neural basis of avatar and self-identification in addictive use. Method(s): About 19 pathological Internet gamers, 19 pathological social network users, and 19 healthy controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while completing a self-retrieval paradigm, asking participants to rate the degree to which various self-concept-related characteristics described their self, ideal, and avatar. Self-conceptrelated characteristics were also psychometrically assessed. Result(s): Psychometric testing indicated that pathological Internet gamers exhibited higher self-concept deficits generally, whereas pathological social network users exhibit deficits in emotion regulation only. We observed left AG hyperactivations in Internet gamers during avatar reflection and a correlation with symptom severity. Striatal hypoactivations during self-reflection (vs. ideal reflection) were observed in social network users and were correlated with symptom severity. Discussion and conclusion: Internet gaming addiction appears to be linked to increased identification with one's avatar, evidenced by high left AG activations in pathological Internet gamers. Addiction to social networks seems to be characterized by emotion regulation deficits, reflected by reduced striatal activation during self-reflection compared to during ideal reflection.Copyright © 2016 The Author(s).",Journal of Behavioral Addictions,Sep-16

Even after prolonged periods of abstinence, addicts are at risk of relapse, particularly when cues evoke memories that are associated with drug use. Rodent models mimic many of the core components of addiction, from the initial drug reinforcement to cue-associated relapse and continued drug intake despite negative consequences. Rodent models have also enabled unprecedented mechanistic insight into addiction, revealing plasticity of glutamatergic synaptic transmission evoked by the strong activation of mesolimbic dopamine-a defining feature of all addictive drugs-as a neural substrate for these drug-adaptive behaviors. Cell type-specific optogenetic manipulations have allowed both identification of the relevant circuits and design of protocols to reverse drug-evoked plasticity and to establish links of causality with drug-adaptive behaviors. The emergence of a circuit model for addiction will open the door for novel therapies, such as deep brain stimulation.Copyright ©2016 by Annual Reviews.",,08-Jul-16

The low resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) analysis obtained through event-related potentials (ERPs) under drug-related cues, more specifically in its P3 segment (300-500 ms) in both, alcoholics and crack-cocaine users, showed that the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) was the brain area with the largest change towards increasing activation under drug-related cues in those subjects that kept abstinence during and after the treatment with bilateral tDCS (2 mA, 35 cm2, cathodal left and anodal right) over dlPFC, applied repetitively (five daily sessions). In an additional study in crack-cocaine, which showed craving decreases after repetitive bilateral tDCS, we examined data originating from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and we found increased DTI parameters in the left connection between vmPFC and nucleus accumbens (NAcc), such as the number of voxels, fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), in tDCS-treated crack-cocaine users when compared to the sham-tDCS group. This increasing of DTI parameters was significantly correlated with craving decreasing after the repetitive tDCS. The vmPFC relates to the control of drug seeking, possibly by extinguishing this behavior. In our studies, the bilateral dlPFC tDCS reduced relapses and craving to the drug use, and increased the vmPFC activation under drug cues, which may be of a great importance in the control of drug use in drug addiction.Copyright © 2016, Springer-Verlag Wien.",Journal of Neural Transmission,01-Oct-16

Therapy, including transcranial direct current stimulation, has shown promising results across a range of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. This article reviews the state-of-the-art of neuromodulation for addiction and discusses the opportunities and challenges available for clinicians and researchers interested in advancing the neuromodulation therapy. A neuromodulation-based approach for addiction has the advantage that the effects might be immediate and selective to the dysfunction. If an alteration in the mechanisms of brain plasticity indeed represents the proximal cause for nicotine-associated cognitive decline and is a critical contributor to the early pathogenesis of addiction, novel interventions that forestall the development of symptoms might be possible.Copyright © 2016 S.

Whether STN-DBS should be considered when PD patients experience neuropsychiatric symptoms is controversial. Lack of systematic behavioral evaluation at baseline hampers the understanding of postoperative neuropsychiatric outcomes. Objective(s): This study compares the behavioral profile of a surgical population to that in general PD. Method(s): Single center data from 234 PD surgical candidates were compared to data from 260 non-demented PD patients consulting in 13 PD expert centers at different stages of disease. The latter were considered representative of the general PD population. Neuropsychiatric symptoms were assessed using the Ardouin Scale of Behavior in PD, a guided interview quantifying changes in severity of 21 neuropsychiatric symptoms, classified into psychic non-motor fluctuations, hypo-and hyperdopaminergic behaviors. Multivariate analyses were performed to study differences in behavioral items between the two groups. Result(s): Surgical candidates were younger, had longer disease duration and used significantly higher doses of dopaminergic drugs. After adjustment for covariates, dopaminergic addiction (OR 10.83; p = 0.002), nocturnal hyperactivity (OR 1.87; p = 0.04), excessive hobbyism (OR 2.37; p = 0.008), ""excess in motivation"" (OR 4.02; p < 0.001), psychic OFF (2.87; p < 0.001) and psychic ON (2.10; p = 0.001) fluctuations were more frequent in the surgical candidates. Depressed mood prevailed in the general PD population (OR 0.53; p = 0.045). Conclusion(s): Behavioral complications of dopaminergic treatment are frequent in PD patients candidates for STN-DBS. They cannot be considered as contraindications for STN-DBS but must be taken into account in postoperative management.Copyright © 2016-IOS Press and the authors.

Review

systematic review","Background: The economic costs associated with opioid misuse are immense. Effective interventions for opioid use disorders are available; however, given the scarce resources faced by substance use treatment providers and payers of all kinds, evidence of effectiveness is not always sufficient to encourage adoption of a given therapy-nor should it be. Economic evaluations can provide evidence that will help stakeholders efficiently allocate their resources. Objective(s): The purpose of this study was to review the literature on economic evaluations of opioid use disorder interventions. Method(s): We performed a systematic review of the major electronic databases from inception until August 2015. A sensitive approach was used to ensure a comprehensive list of relevant articles. Given the quality of the existing reviews, we narrowed our search to studies published since 2007. The Drummond checklist was used to evaluate and categorize economic evaluation studies according to their quality. Result(s): A total of 98 articles were identified as potentially relevant to the current study. Of these 98 articles, half (n = 49) were included in this study. Six of the included articles were reviews. The remaining 43 articles reported economic evaluation studies of interventions for opioid use disorders. In general, the evidence on methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) supports previous findings that MMT is an economically advantageous opioid use disorder therapy. The economic literature comparing MMT with other opioid use disorder pharmacotherapies is limited, as is the literature on other forms of therapy. Conclusion(s): With the possible exception of MMT, additional high-quality economic evaluations are needed in order to assess the relative value of existing opioid use disorder interventions.Copyright © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",PharmacoEconomics,01-Sep-16

transcranial magnetic stimulation","Converging lines of evidence suggest that the pathophysiology of pain is mediated to a substantial degree via allostatic neuroadaptations in reward- and stress-related brain circuits. Thus, reward deficiency (RD) represents a within-system neuroadaptation to pain-induced protracted activation of the reward circuits that leads to depletion-like hypodopaminergia, clinically manifested anhedonia, and diminished motivation for natural reinforcers. Anti-reward (AR) conversely pertains to a between-systems neuroadaptation involving over-recruitment of key limbic structures (e.g., the central and basolateral amygdala nuclei, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the lateral tegmental noradrenergic nuclei of the brain stem, the hippocampus and the habenula) responsible for massive outpouring of stressogenic neurochemicals (e.g., norepinephrine, corticotropin releasing factor, vasopressin, hypocretin, and substance P) giving rise to such negative affective states as anxiety, fear and depression. We propose here the Combined Reward deficiency and Anti-reward Model (CReAM), in which biopsychosocial variables modulating brain reward, motivation and stress functions can interact in a 'downward spiral' fashion to exacerbate the intensity, chronicity and comorbidities of chronic pain syndromes (i.e., pain chronification).Copyright © 2016 The Authors.",Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews,01-Sep-16

Individuals high in negative urgency, the tendency to act rashly when experiencing negative emotions, are at particular risk for abusing alcohol. Alcohol abuse among individuals high in negative urgency may be due to (a) increased activity in the brain's striatum, (b) decreased activity in brain regions associated with self-control, or (c) a combination of the two. Methods Thirty eight non-alcohol-dependent participants completed a measure of negative urgency and then underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while passively viewing pleasant and alcohol images. Results Alcohol images (as compared to pleasant images) were associated with activation in the caudate nucleus, a brain region associated with linking reward to external stimuli. Negative urgency (above and beyond other facets of impulsivity) correlated positively with this caudate activation in response to alcohol images. Alcohol images and negative urgency were unassociated with activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex, a self-regulatory brain region. Conclusions These findings provide initial support that the alcohol abuse observed among individuals high in negative urgency may be due, in part, to heightened reactivity in the striatum to alcohol. Investigating such neural contributors to self-regulation failure is crucial to reducing substance abuse.Copyright © 2016 The Authors",Drug and Alcohol Dependence,01-Jun-16

Recent interest in individuals with gray zone expansions (41-54 CGG repeats) has grown due to reported phenotypes that are similar to those observed in premutation carriers, including neurological, molecular, and cognitive signs. The purpose of this manuscript is to describe a series of adults with FMR1 alleles in the gray zone presenting with movement disorders or memory loss. Gray zone carriers ascertained in large FMR1 screening studies were identified and their clinical phenotypes studied. Thirty-one gray zone allele carriers were included, with mean age of symptom onset of 53 years in patients with movement disorders and 57 years in those with memory loss. Four patients were chosen for illustrative case reports and had the following diagnoses: early-onset Parkinson disease (PD), atypical parkinsonism, dementia, and atypical essential tremor. Some gray zone carriers presenting with parkinsonism had typical features, including bradykinesia, rigidity, and a positive response to dopaminergic medication. These patients had a higher prevalence of peripheral neuropathy and psychiatric complaints than would be expected. The patients seen in memory clinics had standard presentations of cognitive impairment with no apparent differences. Further studies are necessary to determine the associations between FMR1 expansions in the gray zone and various phenotypes of neurological dysfunction.Copyright © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Cerebellum,01-Oct-16

transcranial magnetic stimulation","Localized stimulation of the human brain to treat neuropsychiatric disorders has been in place for over 20 years. Although these methods have been used to a greater extent for mood and movement disorders, recent work has explored brain stimulation methods as potential treatments for addiction. The rationale behind stimulation therapy in addiction involves reestablishing normal brain function in target regions in an effort to dampen addictive behaviors. In this review, we present the rationale and studies investigating brain stimulation in addiction, including transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation, and deep brain stimulation. Overall, these studies indicate that brain stimulation has an acute effect on craving for drugs and alcohol, but few studies have investigated the effect of brain stimulation on actual drug and alcohol use or relapse. Stimulation therapies may achieve their effect through direct or indirect modulation of brain regions involved in addiction, either acutely or through plastic changes in neuronal transmission. Although these mechanisms are not well understood, further identification of the underlying neurobiology of addiction and rigorous evaluation of brain stimulation methods has the potential for unlocking an effective, long-term treatment of addiction.",Neuropsychopharmacology,01-Nov-16

Review","Addiction involves an inability to control drug-seeking behavior. While this may be thought of as secondary to an overwhelming desire for drugs, it could equally well reflect a failure of the brain mechanisms that allow addicts to learn about and mentally simulate non-drug consequences. Importantly, this process of mental simulation draws upon, but is not normally bound by, our past experiences. Rather we have the ability to think outside the box of our past, integrating knowledge gained from a variety of similar and not-so-similar life experiences to derive estimates or imagine what might happen next. These estimates influence our current behavior directly and also affect future behavior by serving as the background against which outcomes are evaluated to support learning. Here we will review evidence, from our own work using a Pavlovian over-expectation task as well as from other sources, that the orbitofrontal cortex is a critical node in the neural circuit that generates these estimates. Further we will offer the specific hypothesis that degradation of this function secondary to drug-induced changes is a critical and likely addressable part of addiction.Copyright © 2016 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.

While the powerful effects of cocaine use on behavior were documented in the 19th century, it was not until the late 20th century that we realized cocaine use was affecting brain tissue and function. Following a brief introduction (Section 1), this chapter will summarize our current knowledge regarding alterations in neural circuit function typically observed in chronic cocaine users (Section 2) and highlight an emerging body of literature which suggests that pretreatment limbic circuit activity may be a reliable predictor of clinical outcomes among individuals seeking treatment for cocaine (Section 3). Finally, as the field of addiction research strives to translate this neuroimaging data into something clinically meaningful, we will highlight several new brain stimulation approaches which utilize functional brain imaging data to design noninvasive brain stimulation interventions for individuals seeking treatment for substance dependence disorders (Section 4).Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",,2016

visual hallucination / drug therapy","Cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms are common in Parkinson's Disease and may surpass motor symptoms as the major factors impacting patient quality of life. The symptoms may be broadly separated into those associated with the disease process and those that represent adverse effects of treatment. Symptoms attributed to the disease arise from pathologic changes within multiple brain regions and are not restricted to dysfunction in the dopaminergic system. Mood symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and apathy are common and may precede the development of motor symptoms by years, while other neuropsychiatric symptoms such as cognitive impairment, dementia, and psychosis are more common in later stages of the disease.

withdrawal syndrome / drug therapy","Craving is a central feature of addiction. Its recent inclusion as a diagnostic criterion for substance use disorders in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders appears at a time when craving research is at an all-time high. Craving is thought to predict relapse and may deter individuals from even trying to quit. Researchers have developed experimental craving-induction paradigms to identify factors contributing to craving and to test interventions to alleviate craving. This review offers a critique of laboratory craving studies, with particular emphasis on cigarette craving. It raises questions concerning several conceptual and methodological assumptions underlying this research, identifies processes that may explain why cravings are linked to drug use and relapse, addresses contextual factors that may influence various experiences of craving, and considers recent interventions targeting craving. The relation between craving and both emotion and coping is discussed, as well as the level of insight that individuals have about their own future cravings.Copyright ©2016 by Annual Reviews.

Here we discuss the different cognitive processes involved in decision making and its associated neural substrates. The putative conductors in decision making appear to be the prefrontal cortex and the striatum. Impaired decision-making skills in various clinical populations have been associated with activity in the prefrontal cortex and in the striatum. We highlight the importance of strengthening the degree of integration of both cognitive and neural substrates in order to further our understanding of decision-making skills. In terms of cognitive paradigms, there is a need to improve the ecological value of experimental tasks that assess decision making in various contexts and with rewards; this would help translate laboratory learnings into real-life benefits. In terms of neural substrates, the use of neuroimaging techniques helps characterize the neural networks associated with decision making; more recently, ways to modulate brain activity, such as in the prefrontal cortex and connected regions (eg, striatum), with noninvasive brain stimulation have also shed light on the neural and cognitive substrates of decision making. Together, these cognitive and neural approaches might be useful for patients with impaired decision-making skills. The drive behind this line of work is that decision-making abilities underlie important aspects of wellness, health, security, and financial and social choices in our daily lives.Copyright © 2016 AICH - Servier Research Group.

ventral tegmentum","Cannabis is the most frequently used illicit drug worldwide, but little is known about the mechanisms underlying continued cannabis use. Cue-reactivity (the physical, psychological, behavioural and neural reaction to substance-related cues) might be related to continued cannabis use. In this 3-year prospective neuroimaging study we investigated whether cannabis cue-induced brain activity predicted continued cannabis use and associated problem severity 3 years later. In addition, baseline brain activations were compared between dependent and non-dependent cannabis users at follow-up. Analyses were focussed on brain areas known to be important in cannabis cue-reactivity: anterior cingulate cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, ventral tegmental area, amygdala and striatum. At baseline, 31 treatment-naive frequent cannabis users performed a cue-reactivity functional magnetic resonance imaging task. Of these participants, 23 completed the 3-year follow-up. None of the cue-induced region of interest activations predicted the amount of cannabis use at follow-up. However, cue-induced activation in the left striatum (putamen) significantly and independently predicted problem severity at follow-up (p < 0.001) as assessed with the Cannabis Use Disorder Identification Test. Also, clinically dependent cannabis users at follow-up showed higher baseline activation at trend level in the left striatum compared with non-dependent users. This indicates that neural cue-reactivity in the dorsal striatum is an independent predictor of cannabis use-related problems. Given the relatively small sample size, these results are preliminary and should be replicated in larger samples of cannabis users.Copyright © The Author(s) 2015.",Journal of Psychopharmacology,01-Feb-16

translational research","Motivation, defined as the energizing of behavior in pursuit of a goal, is a fundamental element of our interaction with the world and with each other. All animals share motivation to obtain their basic needs, including food, water, sex and social interaction. Meeting these needs is a requirement for survival, but in all cases the goals must be met in appropriate quantities and at appropriate times. Therefore motivational drive must be modulated as a function of both internal states as well as external environmental conditions. The regulation of motivated behaviors is achieved by the coordinated action of molecules (peptides, hormones, neurotransmitters etc), acting within specific circuits that integrate multiple signals in order for complex decisions to be made. In the past few decades, there has been a great deal of research on the biology and psychology of motivation. This work includes the investigation of specific aspects of motived behavior using multiple levels of analyses, which allows for the identification of the underpinning neurobiological mechanisms that support relevant psychological processes. In this chapter we provide an overview to the volume ""The Behavioural Neuroscience of Motivation"". The volume includes succinct summaries of; The neurobiology of components of healthy motivational drive, neural measures and correlates of motivation in humans and other animals as well as information on disorders in which abnormal motivation plays a major role. Deficits in motivation occur in a number of psychiatric disorders, affecting a large population, and severe disturbance of motivation can be devastating. Therefore, we also include a section on the development of treatments for disorders of motivation. It is hoped that the collection of reviews in the volume will expose scientists to a breadth of ideas from several different subdisciplines, thereby inspiring new directions of research that may increase our understanding of motivational regulation and bring us closer to effective treatments for disorders of motivation.Copyright © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,01-Jun-16

A wealth of studies now supports the postulate that epigenetic mechanisms underlie both normal and pathological memory processes. Method(s): We selectively reviewed the literature pertinent to the role of epigenetics in behavioral sensitization phenomena and discuss its clinical implications. Result(s): Epigenetics means above genetics and refers to environmental effects on the chemistry of DNA, histones (around which DNA is wound), and microRNA that change how easily genes are turned on and off. The evidence supports that sensitization to repeated stressor, affective episodes, and substance is likely based on epigenetic mechanisms and that these environmentally based processes can then become targets for prevention, early intervention, and ongoing treatment. Sensitization processes are remediable or preventable risk factors for a poor illness outcome and deserve increased clinical, public health, and research attention in the hopes of making the recurrent unipolar and bipolar affective disorders less impairing, disabling, and lethal by suicide and increased medical mortality. Conclusion(s): The findings that epigenetic chemical marks, which change in the most fundamental way how genes are regulated, mediate the long-term increased responsivity to recurrent stressors, mood episodes, and bouts of substance abuse should help change how the affective disorders are conceptualized and move treatment toward earlier, more comprehensive, and sustained pharmacoprophylaxis.Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

All patients reported a complete absence of craving for alcohol; 2 patients remained abstinent for many years and 3 patients showed a marked reduction of alcohol consumption. No severe or long-standing side effects occurred. Therefore, DBS could be a promising, novel treatment option for severe alcohol addiction, but larger clinical trials are needed to further investigate the efficacy of DBS in addiction.Copyright © 2016 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart New York.",Pharmacopsychiatry,01-Jul-16

*ventral tegmentum","Drug-related behaviors in both humans and rodents are commonly thought to arise from aberrant learning processes. Preclinical studies demonstrate that the acquisition and expression of many drug-dependent behaviors involves the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a midbrain structure comprised of dopamine, GABA, and glutamate neurons. Drug experience alters the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input onto VTA dopamine neurons, suggesting a critical role for VTA afferents in mediating the effects of drugs. In this review, we present evidence implicating the VTA in drug-related behaviors, highlight the diversity of neuronal populations in the VTA, and discuss the behavioral effects of selectively manipulating VTA afferents. Future experiments are needed to determine which VTA afferents and what neuronal populations in the VTA mediate specific drug-dependent behaviors. Further studies are also necessary for identifying the afferent-specific synaptic alterations onto dopamine and non-dopamine neurons in the VTA following drug administration. The identification of neural circuits and adaptations involved with drug-dependent behaviors can highlight potential neural targets for pharmacological and deep brain stimulation interventions to treat substance abuse disorders.Copyright © 2016 Oliva and Wanat.",Frontiers in Psychiatry,07-Mar-16

While its pathophysiology has not yet been fully elucidated, it may be potentially related to premorbid neuropsychobiological status, as well as to the type of injury and to the neural alterations that it may evoke. Accordingly, optimized approaches for wounded individuals should integrate primary, secondary and tertiary prevention in the form of thorough evaluation of risk factors along with specific interventions to contravene and mitigate the ensuing chronicity. Thus, Premorbid Events phase may encompass assessments of psychological and neurobiological vulnerability factors in conjunction with fostering preparedness and resilience in both military and civilian populations at risk. Injuries per se phase calls for immediate treatment of acute pain in the field by pharmacological agents that spare and even enhance coping and adaptive capabilities. The key objective of the Post Injury Events is to prevent and/or reverse maladaptive peripheral- and central neural system's processes that mediate transformation of acute to chronic pain and to incorporate timely interventions for concomitant mental health problems including post-traumatic stress disorder and addiction We suggest that the proposed continuum of care may avert more disability and suffering than the currently employed less integrated strategies. While the requirements of the armed forces present a pressing need for this integrated continuum and a framework in which it can be most readily implemented, this approach may be also instrumental for the care of civilian casualties.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",Progress in Neurobiology,01-Jun-16

Review

transcranial magnetic stimulation","Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are a major health and social problem worldwide. Brain stimulation holds great promise as an investigational tool to help us understand the pathophysiology of alcohol dependence and as a therapeutic tool to treat AUDs. Numerous studies suggest that glutamatergic, gamma-aminobutyric acidergic, and dopaminergic neurotransmission are altered by alcohol consumption and among patients with AUDs. Alcohol's disruption of neurotransmission is likely to play an important role in its detrimental effects on neuroplasticity, which, in turn, may contribute to the pathophysiology of alcohol dependence. Specifically, aberrant neuroplasticity in the brain reward circuitry is a potential mechanism underlying the pathophysiology of alcohol dependence. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), a part of the brain's reward circuitry, is directly accessible to noninvasive brain stimulation and may represent a potential target for the treatment of AUDs. While the literature suggests that impairments in neuroplasticity are likely to be present in the DLPFC and brain reward circuitry in alcohol-dependent patients, this is yet to be directly evaluated in humans. Findings from numerous neuromodulatory brain stimulation studies demonstrate that altering neuroplasticity in the DLPFC in alcohol-dependent patients holds promise as a treatment for alcohol dependence, but the optimal neuromodulatory parameters are yet to be identified. Gaining a better understanding of alcohol dependence vis a vis neuroplasticity in the DLPFC and brain reward circuitry can help us optimize the treatment of alcohol dependence using neuromodulatory brain stimulation in the DLPFC.Copyright © 2016 Society of Biological Psychiatry.",Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging,01-Jan-16

The purpose of the present review is to illustrate the biological and clinical aspects of psychiatric conditions associated with PD, with particular reference to the differences with respect to classical psychiatric disorders. A careful search of articles on main databases was performed in order to obtain a comprehensive review about the main psychiatric conditions associated with PD. A manual selection of the articles was then performed in order to consider only those articles that concerned with the topic of the review. Psychiatric conditions in patients with PD present substantial differences with respect to classical psychiatric disorders. Their clinical presentation does not align with the symptom profiles represented by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders and International Classification of Diseases. Furthermore, psychiatry treatment guidelines are of poor help in managing psychiatric symptoms of patients with PD. Specific diagnostic tools and treatment guidelines are needed to allow early diagnosis and adequate treatment of psychiatric conditions in comorbidity with PD.Copyright © 2015 SAGE Publications.",Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry and Neurology,01-Mar-16

Next, it discusses the importance of attentional bias in the development, continuation of, and relapsing to substance abuse. It further proceeds with a review of selective evidence from cognitive psychology that helps account for making decisions about using an addictive substance or refraining from using it. A discussion on the various brain loci that are involved in attentional bias and other kinds of cue reactivity is followed by presenting findings from neurocognitive research. Finally, from an interdisciplinary perspective, the chapter presents new trends and ideas that can be applied to addiction-related cognitive measurement and training.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Due to these effects, ketamine has been withdrawn from mainstream anesthetic use in adult patients. Evoked potentials (EPs) are utilized to monitor neural pathways during surgery, detect intraoperative stress or damage, detect and define the level of neural lesions, and define abnormalities. Unfortunately, many of the volatile anesthetics commonly used during spinal and neurologic procedures suppress EP amplitude and monitoring. Ketamine has been found in several preclinical and clinical studies to actually increase EP amplitude and thus has been used as an analgesic adjunct in procedures where EP monitoring is critical. Once the gap in our knowledge of ketamine's risks has been sufficiently addressed in animal models, informed clinical trials should be conducted in order to properly incorporate ketamine-based anesthetic regimens during EP-monitored neurosurgeries.Copyright © 2016 Stoicea, Versteeg, Florescu, Joseph, Fiorda-Diaz, Navarrete and Bergese.",Frontiers in Neuroscience,16-Feb-16

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has been shown to modulate cognitive control circuits. Although prior studies show that stimulation reduces cigarette craving and self-reported smoking, effects on ability to resist smoking have not been investigated directly. Objectives We assessed effects of a single 20-minute session of 1.0 mA anodal stimulation over the left DLPFC with cathodal stimulation over the right supra-orbital area (vs. sham stimulation) on ability to resist smoking in a validated smoking lapse paradigm. Methods Twenty-five participants completed two tDCS sessions (active and sham stimulation) in a within-subject, double-blind, randomized and counterbalanced order with a 2-week washout period. Following overnight abstinence, participants received tDCS in the presence of smoking related cues; they had the option to smoke at any time or receive $1 for every 5 minutes they abstained. After 50 minutes, they participated in a 1 hour ad libitum smoking session. Primary and secondary outcomes were time to first cigarette and cigarette consumption, respectively. Results In multiple regression models, active tDCS (compared to sham) significantly increased latency to smoke (p = 0.02) and decreased the total number of cigarettes smoked (p = 0.014) during the session. Conclusion These findings suggest that acute anodal stimulation over the left DLPFC (with cathodal stimulation over the right supra-orbital area) can improve ability to resist smoking, supporting the therapeutic potential of tDCS for smoking cessation treatment.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

While motor benefits are well documented, cognitive and psychiatric side effects from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and globus pallidus interna (GPi) DBS for PD are increasingly recognized. Underlying disease, medications, microlesions, and post-surgical stimulation likely all contribute to non-motor symptoms (NMS).Copyright © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Current Neurology and Neuroscience Reports,01-Oct-16

However, the biological mechanistic structure underlying the behavioral undercontrol/substance use relationship is not well understood. The enzyme catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) catabolizes dopamine and norepinephrine in the prefrontal cortex and striatum, brain regions involved in behavioral control. The goal of this work was to investigate the association between genetic variation in COMT functioning and fronto-striatal brain functioning during successful inhibitory control, a critical aspect of behavioral control. Method(s): Participants were 65 (22 female) 7-12 year olds who were genotyped for the functional COMT Val158Met (rs4680) single-nucleotide polymorphism and underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing a go/no-go task. The majority of the sample (80%) had at least one parent with a history of alcohol use disorder and were thus at heightened risk for substance use disorders. Result(s): There was a significant main effect of genotype on brain activation in left and right putamen during successful versus failed inhibition and in right inferior frontal gyrus/insula during successful inhibition versus baseline. Follow-up tests revealed that Met homozygotes had greater activation in each region relative to Val homozygotes. Conclusion(s): These results are relevant for understanding how specific genes influence brain functioning related to underlying risk factors for substance use disorders and other disinhibitory psychopathologies.Copyright © 2016 The Authors.

withdrawal syndrome","Substance use disorders are common, but only a small minority of patients receive adequate treatment. Although psychosocial therapies are effective, relapse is common. This review focusses on novel pharmacological and other treatments for patients with alcohol, opioid, or cocaine use disorders who do not respond to conventional treatments. Disulfiram, acamprosate, and the opioid antagonist naltrexone have been approved for the treatment of alcoholism. A novel, ""as needed"" approach is the use of the mu-opioid antagonist and partial kappa agonist nalmefene to reduce alcohol consumption. Other novel pharmacological approaches include the GABA-B receptor agonist baclofen, anticonvulsants such as topiramate and gabapentin, the partial nicotine receptor agonist varenicline, and other drugs. For opioid dependence, opioid agonist therapy with methadone or buprenorphine is the first-line treatment option. Other options include oral or depot naltrexone, morphine sulfate, depot or implant formulations, and heroin (diacetylmorphine) in treatment-refractory patients. To date, no pharmacological treatment has been approved for cocaine addiction; however, 3 potential pharmacological treatments are being studied, disulfiram, methylphenidate, and modafinil. Pharmacogenetic approaches may help to optimize treatment response in otherwise treatment-refractory patients and to identify which patients are more likely to respond to treatment, and neuromodulation techniques such as repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation and deep brain stimulation also may play a role in the treatment of substance use disorders. Although no magic bullet is in sight for treatment-refractory patients, some novel medications and brain stimulation techniques have the potential to enrich treatment options at least for some patients.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry,2016

Review

traumatic brain injury","Deep brain stimulation (DBS) implantation surgery is an established treatment modality for a variety of medical refractory movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, essential tremors and dystonia. Following the success of DBS in these movement disorders with a high rate of safety and eficacy, there is a resurgence of interest in the utility of this modality in other medical refractory disorders. Consequently, neuromodulation has been explored for a variety of refractory conditions such as neuropsychiatric disorders (major depressive disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorders, addictions), eating disorders including obesity, traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD), dementias and chronic pain. This review provides an overview of the emerging applications of DBS in these disorders, including summary of the published literature. We have highlighted the pathophysiology and likely aberrant neural circuits involved in these refractory disorders. Current and possible surgical targets for neurosurgical intervention related to these disorders have also been discussed. Furthermore, recent advances such as closed loop systems; responsive neurostimulation systems and optogenetics techniques have been addressed.Copyright © 2016 EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA.",Journal of Neurosurgical Sciences,2016

Review

time to treatment","The abuse of stimulants such as cocaine, amphetamine, and methamphetamine is a huge problem in many parts of the world. Abuse of these drugs does not ruin just the user's life, but also adversely affects those around them. Despite many years of research, there are no approved medications for stimulant dependence, and treatment is focused on psychotherapy and abstinence. Over the last 10 to 20 years, there have been some major changes in approach to medication development for stimulant dependence. These include assessing ligands for non-dopaminergic sites, atypical dopamine transporter ligands, blocking long-term potentiation and/or memory reconsolidation, vaccines against the stimulant, and molecular approaches including pharmacogenomics and gene silencing. Also included in this overview are non-drug treatments such as deep brain stimulation and psychosurgery. This overview highlights recent preclinical and clinical studies of treatment development for stimulant dependence.Copyright © 2016 Hong Kong College of Psychiatrists.",East Asian Archives of Psychiatry,Jun-16

translational research","Mental disorders are among the greatest medical and social challenges facing us. They can occur at all stages of life and are among the most important commonly occurring diseases. In Germany 28 % of the population suffer from a mental disorder every year, while the lifetime risk of suffering from a mental disorder is almost 50 %. Mental disorders cause great suffering for those affected and their social network. Quantitatively speaking, they can be considered to be among those diseases creating the greatest burden for society due to reduced productivity, absence from work and premature retirement. The Federal Ministry of Education and Research is funding a new research network from 2015 to 2019 with up to 35 million euros to investigate mental disorders in order to devise and develop better therapeutic measures and strategies for this population by means of basic and translational clinical research. This is the result of a competitive call for research proposals entitled research network for mental diseases. It is a nationwide network of nine consortia with up to ten psychiatric and clinical psychology partner institutions from largely university-based research facilities for adults and/or children and adolescents. Furthermore, three cross-consortia platform projects will seek to identify shared causes of diseases and new diagnostic modalities for anxiety disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (ADHS), autism, bipolar disorders, depression, schizophrenia and psychotic disorders as well as substance-related and addictive disorders. The spectrum of therapeutic approaches to be examined ranges from innovative pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatment to novel brain stimulation procedures. In light of the enormous burden such diseases represent for society as a whole, a sustainable improvement in the financial support for those researching mental disorders seems essential. This network aims to become a nucleus for long overdue and sustained support for a German center for mental disorders.Copyright © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Nervenarzt,01-Sep-16

Our objective was to identify whether chronic alcohol consumption was associated with a negative effect on tremor outcome after thalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) in ET patients. We conducted a retrospective chart review, from January 2005 to December 2012, from which 23 patients who had ventral intermediate nucleus (Vim)-DBS surgery for ET were identified. Seven patients had a positive history of chronic alcohol consumption. We defined as chronic alcohol users those patients with a habit of drinking alcohol every day in order to suppress tremor. In the overall group of 23 patients, there was a reduction in the median tremor score from 8 pre-operatively, to 1 post-operatively (p < 0.0001). The alcohol consumers group experienced a reduction in the median tremor score from 6 pre-operatively to 0 post-operatively (p = 0.03). The non-alcohol consumers group had a reduction in the median tremor score from 8 pre-operatively to 1.7 post-operatively (p < 0.0001). Both groups of patients experienced significant benefit from thalamic DBS. A larger study may reveal statistically significant differences between subgroups.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Journal of Clinical Neuroscience,01-Sep-16

Also, the training's generalization effects and the moderating role of executive control (EC) were examined. Method(s): Participants were 98 young hazardous drinkers. Half of the participants were trained to interpret ambiguous alcohol-related scenarios in an alcohol-unrelated way (neutral CBM-I), the other half completed alcohol-related ambiguous open-ended scenarios (control CBM-I). Alcohol-related IBs were assessed with open-ended ambiguous alcohol-related scenarios, completed by participants. The completions were coded by participants (self-coding) and by two independent coders (conservatively and liberally). Result(s): Neutral CBM-I, compared to control CBM-I, did not decrease alcohol-related IBs for the conservative and self-coding. For the liberal coding, both groups showed a decrease in alcohol-related IBs pre to post training. Moreover, there were no group differences in interpreting ambiguous, alcohol-related pictures during a signal-detection task. At the behavioral level, there was no reduction in alcohol use for either group at one week follow-up. Finally, EC did not moderate training effects. Conclusion(s): Although CBM-I effects were largely absent; the findings emphasize that more research into the working mechanisms of alcohol CBM-I is needed to test its potential in the context of hazardous drinking.",Sucht,Dec-16

Method(s): We searched the literature by using keywords ""rTMS,"" ""tDCS,"" ""emotion regulation,"" and ""decision-making"" on PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed). Based on the search results, we reviewed studies on emotion regulation and decision-making using rTMS and tDCS modulations. Result(s): Regarding emotion regulation, rTMS can influence both attentional and affective aspects of emotion regulation. tDCS studies for emotion regulation included diverse topics such as physiological arousal, social exclusion, mathematics anxiety, emotional reactions to pain stimuli, negative affect, momentary ruminative self-referent thoughts, and autonomic reactions to affective pictures. Decision-making studies have reported rTMS effects related to emotion such as delay-discounting tasks, food choice, and moral judgment. These studies have also investigated cognitive functions such as visuospatial attention, perception, object identification, spatial-working memory, visuomotor skills, task, and blameworthiness and punishment decisions. In tDCS studies for decision-making, it has increasingly been reported that tDCS influences moral judgment, risk-taking behaviors, choice modulation, delay discounting, maladaptive and perceptual decision-making, probabilistic guessing, perception of space and time, dual-task performance, model-based learning, addiction, food craving, sunk-cost effect, exploration-exploitation trade-offs and cognitive impulse control. Conclusion(s): rTMS and tDCS have been shown to modulate behaviors relevant to emotion regulation and decision-making. The results of these numerous studies can be applied to clinical populations, and demonstrate that rTMS and tDCS may have many beneficial implications to those who have emotion regulation deficiencies.Copyright © 2016 The Author(s).",Neuropsychiatric Electrophysiology,2016

voxel based morphometry","The salience network (SN) plays a central role in cognitive control by integrating sensory input to guide attention, attend to motivationally salient stimuli and recruit appropriate functional brain-behavior networks to modulate behavior. Mounting evidence suggests that disturbances in SN function underlie abnormalities in cognitive control and may be a common etiology underlying many psychiatric disorders. Such functional and anatomical abnormalities have been recently apparent in studies and meta-analyses of psychiatric illness using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and voxelbased morphometry (VBM). Of particular importance, abnormal structure and function in major cortical nodes of the SN, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and anterior insula (AI), have been observed as a common neurobiological substrate across a broad spectrum of psychiatric disorders. In addition to cortical nodes of the SN, the network's associated subcortical structures, including the dorsal striatum, mediodorsal thalamus and dopaminergic brainstem nuclei, comprise a discrete regulatory loop circuit. The SN's cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loop increasingly appears to be central to mechanisms of cognitive control, as well as to a broad spectrum of psychiatric illnesses and their available treatments. Functional imbalances within the SN loop appear to impair cognitive control, and specifically may impair self-regulation of cognition, behavior and emotion, thereby leading to symptoms of psychiatric illness. Furthermore, treating such psychiatric illnesses using invasive or non-invasive brain stimulation techniques appears to modulate SN cortical-subcortical loop integrity, and these effects may be central to the therapeutic mechanisms of brain stimulation treatments in many psychiatric illnesses. Here, we review clinical and experimental evidence for abnormalities in SN cortico-striatal-thalamic loop circuits in major depression, substance use disorders (SUD), anxiety disorders, schizophrenia and eating disorders (ED). We also review emergent therapeutic evidence that novel invasive and non-invasive brain stimulation treatments may exert therapeutic effects by normalizing abnormalities in the SN loop, thereby restoring the capacity for cognitive control. Finally, we consider a series of promising directions for future investigations on the role of SN cortico-striatal-thalamic loop circuits in the pathophysiology and treatment of psychiatric disorders.Copyright © 2016 Peters, Dunlop and Downar.",Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience,27-Dec-16

In this work, we describe and evaluate a method that can infer the structural brain network that interconnects a given set of Regions of Interest (ROIs) from probabilistic tractography data. The proposed method, referred to as Minimum Asymmetry Network Inference Algorithm (MANIA), does not determine the connectivity between two ROIs based on an arbitrary connectivity threshold. Instead, we exploit a basic limitation of the tractography process: the observed streamlines from a source to a target do not provide any information about the polarity of the underlying white matter, and so if there are some fibers connecting two voxels (or two ROIs) X and Y, tractography should be able in principle to follow this connection in both directions, from X to Y and from Y to X. We leverage this limitation to formulate the network inference process as an optimization problem that minimizes the (appropriately normalized) asymmetry of the observed network. We evaluate the proposed method using both the FiberCup dataset and based on a noise model that randomly corrupts the observed connectivity of synthetic networks. As a case-study, we apply MANIA on diffusion MRI data from 28 healthy subjects to infer the structural network between 18 corticolimbic ROIs that are associated with various neuropsychiatric conditions including depression, anxiety and addiction.Copyright © 2016 Shadi, Bakhshi, Gutman, Mayberg and Dovrolis.",Frontiers in Neuroinformatics,04-Nov-16

transcranial magnetic stimulation","Objective: Nicotine dependence accounts for significant mortality, morbidity, and socio-economic burdens. It remains a significant public health concern since it is among the leading causes of mortality worldwide and of preventable deaths in developed countries. Despite the availability of approved medications to treat nicotine dependence, along with cognitive behavioral therapy, only 6% of the total number of smokers who report wanting to quit each year are successful in doing so for more than a month mostly with poor abstinence rates. Urgent therapeutic alternatives are therefore needed such as neurostimulation techniques. The purpose of this review is to describe studies that have evaluated the safety and efficacy of these techniques for the treatment of nicotine dependence. Method(s): The electronic literature on repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, theta-burst stimulation, deep transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation, magnetic seizure therapy, electroconvulsive therapy, cranial electro-stimulation, and deep brain stimulation in the treatment of nicotine addiction were reviewed. Result(s): Most of these studies found that some of these neurostimulation techniques are safe and potentially effective in the reduction of craving to nicotine as well as in the reduction of cigarette consumption. Conclusion and Scientific Significance: Given the promising results of some of the studies particularly with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, theta-burst stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation and, possibly, deep transcranial magnetic stimulation, future controlled studies with larger samples, and optimal stimulus parameters should be designed to confirm these findings.

translational research","In the last decade, optogenetics has revolutionised the neurosciences. The technique, which allows for cell-type specific excitation and inhibition of neurons in the brain of freely moving rodents, has been used to tighten the links of causality between neural activity and behaviour. Optogenetics is also enabling an unprecedented characterisation of circuits and their dysfunction in a number of brain diseases, above all those conditions that are not caused by neurodegeneration. Notable progress has been made in addiction, depression and obsessive-compulsive disorders, as well as other anxiety disorders. By extension, the technique has also been used to propose blueprints for innovative rational treatment of these diseases. The goal is to design manipulations that disrupt pathological circuit function or restore normal activity. This can be achieved by targeting specific projections in order to apply specific stimulation protocols validated by ex-vivo analysis of the mechanisms underlying the dysfunction. In a number of cases, specific forms of pathological synaptic plasticity have been implicated. For example, addictive drugs via strong increase of dopamine trigger a myriad of alterations of glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid transmission, also called drug-evoked synaptic plasticity. This opens the way to the design of optogenetic reversal protocols, which might restore normal transmission with the hope to abolish the pathological behaviour. Several proof of principle studies for this approach have recently been published. However, for many reasons, optogenetics will not be translatable to human applications in the near future. Here, we argue that an intermediate step is novel deep brain stimulation (DBS) protocols that emulate successful optogenetic approaches in animal models. We provide a roadmap for a translational path to rational, optogenetically inspired DBS protocols to refine existing approaches and expand to novel indications.",Swiss medical weekly,2016

vagus nerve stimulation","Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has become a well-accepted therapy to treat movement disorders, including Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, and dystonia. Long-term follow-up studies have demonstrated sustained improvement in motor symptoms and quality of life. DBS offers the opportunity to selectively modulate the targeted brain regions and related networks. Moreover, stimulation can be adjusted according to individual patients' demands, and stimulation is reversible. This has led to the introduction of DBS as a treatment for further neurological and psychiatric disorders and many clinical studies investigating the efficacy of stimulating various brain regions in order to alleviate severe neurological or psychiatric disorders including epilepsy, major depression, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. In this review, we provide an overview of accepted and experimental indications for DBS therapy and the corresponding anatomical targets.Copyright © 2015 Kocabicak et al.",Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment,09-Apr-15

weight gain

weight reduction","Recent advances in medications and surgical therapy for neurological disorders may offer new therapeutic options for the treatment of myoclonus. Appropriate therapy for myoclonus depends on the etiology, and in some cases, myoclonus can improve when the provoking cause is eliminated. When the underlying cause for the movements is not immediately reversible, localization, disease pathophysiology, and etiology may each play a role in determining the most appropriate symptomatic treatment of disabling myoclonic jerks. While the use of many agents is still based on small, open-label case series and anecdotes, there is a growing body of evidence from head-to-head comparative trials in several types of myoclonus that may help guide therapy. New therapies for refractory myoclonus, including sodium oxybate and even deep brain stimulation, are also being explored with increasing enthusiasm.Copyright © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Current Neurology and Neuroscience Reports,Jan-15

Review

traumatic brain injury","For over two decades, deep brain stimulation (DBS) has shown significant efficacy in treatment for refractory cases of dyskinesia, specifically in cases of Parkinson's disease and dystonia. DBS offers potential alleviation from symptoms through a well-tolerated procedure that allows personalized modulation of targeted neuroanatomical regions and related circuitries. For clinicians contending with how to provide patients with meaningful alleviation from often debilitating intractable disorders, DBSs titratability and reversibility make it an attractive treatment option for indications ranging from traumatic brain injury to progressive epileptic supra-synchrony. The expansion of our collective knowledge of pathologic brain circuitries, as well as advances in imaging capabilities, electrophysiology techniques, and material sciences have contributed to the expanding application of DBS. This review will examine the potential efficacy of DBS for neurologic and psychiatric disorders currently under clinical investigation and will summarize findings from recent animal models.Copyright © 2015, Japan Neurosurgical Society.

Accumulating evidence, based on human and animal studies, has led to models for interpreting the neural basis of cognitive functions as interactions between functionally related brain regions. In this review, we focus on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies using brain connectivity techniques as related to CD. The majority of these brain connectivity studies indicated that cocaine use is associated with altered brain connectivity between different structures, including cortical-striatal regions and default mode network. In cocaine users some of the altered brain connectivity measures are associated with behavioral performance, history of drug use, and treatment outcome. The implications of these brain connectivity findings to the treatment of CD and the pros and cons of the major brain connectivity techniques are discussed. Finally potential future directions in cocaine use disorder research using brain connectivity techniques are briefly described.Copyright © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",Expert Review of Neurotherapeutics,02-Nov-15

working memory","The ventral pallidum (VP) plays a critical role in the processing and execution of motivated behaviors. Yet this brain region is often overlooked in published discussions of the neurobiology of mental health (. e.g., addiction, depression). This contributes to a gap in understanding the neurobiological mechanisms of psychiatric disorders. This review is presented to help bridge the gap by providing a resource for current knowledge of VP anatomy, projection patterns and subregional circuits, and how this organization relates to the function of VP neurons and ultimately behavior. For example, ventromedial (VPvm) and dorsolateral (VPdl) VP subregions receive projections from nucleus accumbens shell and core, respectively. Inhibitory GABAergic neurons of the VPvm project to mediodorsal thalamus, lateral hypothalamus, and ventral tegmental area, and this VP subregion helps discriminate the appropriate conditions to acquire natural rewards or drugs of abuse, consume preferred foods, and perform working memory tasks. GABAergic neurons of the VPdl project to subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra pars reticulata, and this VP subregion is modulated by, and is necessary for, drug-seeking behavior. Additional circuits arise from nonGABAergic neuronal phenotypes that are likely to excite rather than inhibit their targets. These subregional and neuronal phenotypic circuits place the VP in a unique position to process motivationally relevant stimuli and coherent adaptive behaviors.Copyright © 2015.",Progress in Neurobiology,01-Jul-15

This study examines the differences in functional connectivity of the fronto-parietal cognitive control network (FPn) and the motivational network (striatum and orbitofrontal cortex) between alcohol dependent patients (ADPs) and healthy controls (HCs), and the effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on these networks. This randomized controlled trial included 38 ADPs and 37 HCs, matched on age, gender and education. Participants were randomly assigned to sham or right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) stimulation with rTMS. A 3T resting state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) scan was acquired before and after active or sham 10. Hz rTMS. Group differences of within and between network connectivity and the effect of rTMS on network connectivity was assessed using independent component analysis. Results showed higher connectivity within the left FPn (p=0.012) and the left fronto-striatal motivational network (p=0.03) in ADPs versus HCs, and a further increase in connectivity within the left FPn after active stimulation in ADPs. ADPs also showed higher connectivity between the left and the right FPns (p=0.025), and this higher connectivity was related to fewer alcohol related problems (r=0.30, p=0.06). The results show higher within and between network connectivity in ADPs and a further increase in fronto-parietal connectivity after right dlPFC rTMS in ADPs, suggesting that frontal rTMS may have a beneficial influence on cognitive control and may result in lower relapse rates.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP.",European Neuropsychopharmacology,01-Dec-15

Here we hypothesized that chronic heavy drinking facilitates this energy substrate shift both for baseline and stimulation conditions. To test this hypothesis, we compared the effects of alcohol intoxication (0.75 g/kg alcohol vs placebo) on brain glucose metabolism during video stimulation (VS) versus when given with no stimulation (NS), in 25 heavy drinkers (HDs) and 23 healthy controls, each of whom underwent four PET-18FDG scans. We showed that resting whole-brain glucose metabolism (placebo-NS) was lower in HD than controls (13%, p=0.04); that alcohol (compared with placebo) decreased metabolism more in HD (20+/-13%) than controls (9+/-11%, p=0.005) and in proportion to daily alcohol consumption (r=0.36, p=0.01) but found that alcohol did not reduce the metabolic increases in visual cortex from VS in either group. Instead, VS reduced alcohol-induced decreases in whole-brain glucose metabolism (10+/-12%) compared with NS in both groups (15+/-13%, p=0.04), consistent with stimulation-related glucose metabolism enhancement. These findings corroborate our hypothesis that heavy alcohol consumption facilitates use of alternative energy substrates (i.e., acetate) for resting activity during intoxication, which might persist through early sobriety, but indicate that glucose is still favored as energy substrate during brain stimulation. Our findings are consistent with reduced reliance on glucose as the main energy substrate for resting brain metabolism during intoxication (presumably shifting to acetate or other ketones) and a priming of this shift in HDs, which might make them vulnerable to energy deficits during withdrawal.Copyright ©2015 the authors.",Journal of Neuroscience,18-Feb-15

Method(s): Articles and information sourced from search engines including PubMed and EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Google Scholar were supplemented by literature known to the mood disorders committee (MDC) (e.g., books, book chapters and government reports) and from published depression and bipolar disorder guidelines. Information was reviewed and discussed by members of the MDC and findings were then formulated into consensus-based recommendations and clinical guidance. The guidelines were subjected to rigorous successive consultation and external review involving: expert and clinical advisors, the public, key stakeholders, professional bodies and specialist groups with interest in mood disorders. Result(s): The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists clinical practice guidelines for mood disorders (Mood Disorders CPG) provide up-to-date guidance and advice regarding the management of mood disorders that is informed by evidence and clinical experience. The Mood Disorders CPG is intended for clinical use by psychiatrists, psychologists, physicians and others with an interest in mental health care. Conclusion(s): The Mood Disorder CPG is the first Clinical Practice Guideline to address both depressive and bipolar disorders. It provides up-to-date recommendations and guidance within an evidence-based framework, supplemented by expert clinical consensus.

In this review, we consider the evidence for the effectiveness of deep brain stimulation for psychiatric indications, with a primary focus on obsessive compulsive disorder and major depressive disorder. Method(s): Case reports, case series and clinical trials where deep brain stimulation was primarily utilised in the treatment of a psychiatric disorder, including obsessive compulsive disorder, major depressive disorder, anorexia nervosa or an addictive disorder were identified. The evidence for the effectiveness of deep brain stimulation in the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder and major depressive disorder was reviewed with studies clustered by the site of implantation. Result(s): The majority of identified manuscripts report small case series or single cases. A limited number of studies have reported some form of randomised or blinded stimulation comparison. All of these comparative reports have included small samples of subjects (less than 20 per study in total) compromising the feasibility of making statistical comparison between outcomes in the comparison phases. The two exceptions to this have been industry-sponsored studies conducted in the treatment of major depressive disorder. However, both were stopped prematurely due to concerns about poor efficacy. Conclusion(s): There is insufficient evidence at this point in time to support the use of deep brain stimulation as a clinical treatment for any psychiatric disorder outside of research and programmes where formal outcome data are being systematically collated. While some promising initial data exist to support its potential efficacy for a number of psychiatric conditions, further research is required to establish optimal implantation targets, patient characteristics associated with positive therapeutic outcomes and optimal deep brain stimulation parameters and parameter-programming methods.Copyright © 2015 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists 2015.",Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry,01-Nov-15

withdrawal syndrome / drug therapy","Substance use disorders (SUDs) can be viewed as a pathology of neuroadaptation. The pharmacologicaloverstimulation of neural mechanisms of reward, motivated learning and memory leads to drug-seekingbehavior. A critical characteristic of SUDs is the appearance of craving, the motivated desire and urge touse, which is a main focus of current pharmacological and behavioral therapies. Recent proof-of-conceptstudies have tested the effects of noninvasive brain stimulation on craving. Although its mechanisms ofaction are not fully understood, this approach shows interesting potential in tuning down craving andpossibly consumption of diverse substances. This article reviews available results on the use of repetitivetranscranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) in SUDs, specificallytobacco, alcohol and psychostimulant use disorders. We discuss several important factors that need tobe addressed in future works to improve clinical assessment and effects of noninvasive brain stimulationin SUDs. Factors discussed include brain stimulation devices and parameters, study designs, brain statesand subjects' characteristics.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews,2015

These circuits are essential for cognitive control, motivation, reward dependent learning, and emotional processing. As such, dysfunctions in cortico-striatal circuits are thought to relate to the core features of SUD, which include compulsive drug use, loss of the ability to control drug intake, and the emergence of negative emotional states (Koob and Volkow, 2010. Neuropsychopharmacology 35(1), 217-238). While the brain circuits underlying SUD have been studied in human patients largely through imaging studies, experiments in animals have allowed researchers to examine the specific cell-types within these circuits to reveal their role in behavior relevant to SUD. Here, we will review imaging studies on cortico-striatal systems that are altered in SUD, and describe animal experiments that relate SUD to specific neural projections and cell types within this circuitry. We will end with a discussion of novel clinical approaches such as deep brain stimulation (DBS), repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), and pharmacological targeting of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) heteromers that may provide promising avenues for modulating these circuits to combat SUD in humans.

Using drugs in the face of cues may be associated with dysfunction in at least two frontal-striatal neural circuits: (1) elevated activity in medial and ventral areas that govern limbic arousal (including the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and ventral striatum) or (2) depressed activity in dorsal and lateral areas that govern cognitive control (including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and dorsal striatum). Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is emerging as a promising new tool for the attenuation of craving among multiple substance dependent populations. To date however, nearly all repetitive TMS studies in addiction have focused on amplifying activity in frontal-striatal circuits that govern cognitive control. This manuscript reviews recent work using TMS as a tool to decrease craving for multiple substances and provides a theoretical model for how clinical researchers might approach target and frequency selection for TMS of addiction. To buttress this model, preliminary data from a single-blind, sham-controlled, crossover study of 11 cocaine-dependent individuals is also presented. These results suggest that attenuating MPFC activity through theta burst stimulation decreases activity in the striatum and anterior insula. It is also more likely to attenuate craving than sham TMS. Hence, while many TMS studies are focused on applying LTP-like stimulation to the DLPFC, the MPFC might be a new, efficacious, and treatable target for craving in cocaine dependent individuals.

DBS requires computer-assisted 3D planning to implant the stimulation electrode precisely. Recently, there has been a debate about the true dimensions of NAc in healthy as well as in mentally ill individuals. Knowing its true dimensions in different neuropsychiatric disorders may improve even more precise targeting of NAc for therapeutic DBS. Volumes of NAc of heroin addicts (n = 14) and healthy controls (n = 12) were calculated by using morphometry of serial whole-brain sections. Total brain volume was larger in the heroin group (mean 1478.85 +/- 62.34 vs. mean 1352.38 +/- 103.24 cm3), as the heroin group was more than 10 years younger (p = 0.001). However, the mean volume of the NAc in heroin addicts was smaller than in controls (0.528 +/- 0.166 vs. 0.623 +/- 0.196 cm3; p = 0.019). This group effect did not significantly differ between the hemispheres. When assessed separately, left-hemispheric NAc volume was 15 % lower (p = 0.020), while right-hemispheric NAc volume was 16 % lower (p = 0.047) in the heroin-addicted group compared to controls. Based on these diagnosis-related differences, we believe it is important to further analyze NAc volumes in different psychiatric disorders to further improve precise targeting and electrode placement.Copyright © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",European Archives of Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience,19-Jul-15

Method(s): Structured Clinical Interviews for the DSM-IV, Axis I psychiatric disorders, were prospectively performed before and after surgery. Diagnoses were made based on DSM-IV criteria. Psychiatric disorders were grouped into 5 categories: mood, anxiety, addiction, obsessive-compulsive disorders, and psychosis. Patients could be stratified to more than one category. Rates for unchanged diagnoses, diagnoses in remission, and new-onset diagnoses after surgery for each category were calculated. Result(s): Fifty-seven patients with primary and secondary dystonia were included. Mean +/- SD age at surgery and dystonia duration at time of surgery was 50.6 +/- 13.8 and 19.0 +/- 13.2 years, respectively. Preoperatively, 37 Axis I diagnoses were made in 25 patients, 43.8% of those presenting with at least 1 Axis I diagnosis (mostly mood and anxiety disorders). Mean +/- SD duration of psychiatric follow-up was 24.4 +/- 19.6 months. Overall, after surgery no significant changes (p 0.16) were found in Axis I diagnoses (23 patients, 40.3%): 27 (73%) unchanged, 10 (27%) in complete remission, and 4 (12.9%) new-onset diagnoses. Conclusion(s): Our results support the overall psychiatric stability of patients with primary and secondary dystonia treated with GPi DBS. However, considering the high psychiatric morbidity in the dystonia population, psychiatric assessments before and after surgery are strongly recommended. Classification of evidence: This study provides Class IV evidence that GPi DBS does not change Axis I psychiatric diagnoses in patients with primary and secondary dystonia.Copyright © © 2015 American Academy of Neurology.",Neurology,04-Aug-15

Review

reward","Pleasure is mediated by well-developed mesocorticolimbic circuitry and serves adaptive functions. In affective disorders, anhedonia (lack of pleasure) or dysphoria (negative affect) can result from breakdowns of that hedonic system. Human neuroimaging studies indicate that surprisingly similar circuitry is activated by quite diverse pleasures, suggesting a common neural currency shared by all. Wanting for reward is generated by a large and distributed brain system. Liking, or pleasure itself, is generated by a smaller set of hedonic hot spots within limbic circuitry. Those hot spots also can be embedded in broader anatomical patterns of valence organization, such as in a keyboard pattern of nucleus accumbens generators for desire versus dread. In contrast, some of the best known textbook candidates for pleasure generators, including classic pleasure electrodes and the mesolimbic dopamine system, may not generate pleasure after all. These emerging insights into brain pleasure mechanisms may eventually facilitate better treatments for affective disorders. How does pleasure arise in the brain? Solving that puzzle is a major goal for affective neuroscience. Berridge and Kringelbach assess what is currently known about how brain limbic systems encode and cause pleasure versus displeasure.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Neuron,06-May-15

transcranial magnetic stimulation","Although the importance of the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) in cocaine addiction is well established, its precise contribution to cocaine seeking, taking and relapse remains incompletely understood. In particular, across two different models of cocaine self-administration, pharmacological or optogenetic activation of the dorsal MPFC has been reported to sometimes promote and sometimes inhibit cocaine seeking. We highlight important methodological differences between the two experimental paradigms and propose a framework to potentially reconcile the apparent discrepancy. We also draw parallels between these pre-clinical models of cocaine self-administration and human neuro-imaging studies in cocaine users, and argue that both lines of evidence point to dynamic interactions between cue-reactivity processes and control processes within the dorsal MPFC circuitry. From a translational perspective, these findings underscore the importance of interventions and therapeutics targeting not just a brain region, but a specific computational process within that brain region, and may have implications for the design and implementation of more effective treatments for human cocaine addiction. The contribution of the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) in cocaine addiction remains incompletely understood. Across two different models of cocaine self-administration, pharmacological or optogenetic activation of the dorsal MPFC sometimes promotes and sometimes inhibits cocaine seeking. We propose a framework to reconcile the apparent discrepancy, and argue that both animal models and human neuroimaging studies point to dynamic interactions between cue-reactivity processes and control processes within the dorsal MPFC circuitry, underscoring the importance of interventions targeting a specific computational process within a brain region.Copyright © Published 2014.

This has led to some genuine advances in understanding perception and cognition, and has raised some hopes of applying the knowledge in clinical contexts. There are now several forms of stimulation, the ability to combine these with other methods, and ethical questions that are special to brain stimulation. In this Primer, we aim to give the users of these methods a starting point and perspective from which to view the key questions and usefulness of the different forms of non-invasive brain stimulation. We have done so by taking a critical view of recent highlights in the literature, selected case studies to illustrate the elements necessary and sufficient for good experiments, and pointed to questions and findings that can only be addressed using interference methods.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Neuron,02-Sep-15

Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale","Objective: To describe the clinical features, treatment(s), and outcomes of 15 HIV-infected patients with idiopathic Parkinson disease (PD) and sustained virus suppression and immunologic reconstitution, from a reference cohort of 9847 persons living with HIV (PLH). Method(s): This retrospective, single-center matched case-control 1:2 study included PLH-PD patients evaluated over a 12-year period (2002-2013) with mean follow-up of 6.5 years. PD clinical features and dopamine replacement therapy (DRT) were compared, and biologically relevant HIV data were assessed. Result(s): PD prevalence in PLH was similar to that of the general population. At onset, clinical presentations and therapeutic management were similar for both groups. Rapidly effective DRT was well tolerated without combined antiretroviral therapy interactions or virus escape. At the end of the follow-up, compared with HIVnegative PD, PLH had a significantly lower median Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor score (4 vs 14; P , 0.001), median Hoehn and Yahr stage (1 vs 2; P = 0.0005), and median Handipark scale score (2 vs 3; P = 0.0036) under the same daily DRT. One PLH underwent highly successful deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus. Conclusion(s): HIV-associated PD is similar to idiopathic PD with some features suggesting an HIV-induced functional adaptation of dopaminergic neurons that might counterbalance the PD-induced neuronal loss. Concurrent HIV infection does not compromise the outcome of idiopathic PD.Copyright © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.",Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes,01-Oct-15

However, empirical evidence for a domain general self-regulation mechanism is scarce. The aim of this study was to investigate whether focused anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), facilitating the activity of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), acts on a domain general self-regulation mechanism and thus modulates both affective and appetitive self-regulation. Twenty smokers participated in this within-subject sham controlled study. Effects of anodal left, anodal right and sham tDCS over the dlPFC on affective picture appraisal and nicotine craving-cue appraisal were assessed. Anodal right tDCS over the dlPFC reduced negative affect in emotion appraisal, but neither modulated regulation of positive emotion appraisal nor of craving appraisal. Anodal left stimulation did not induce any significant effects. The results of our study show that domain specific self-regulation networks are at work in the prefrontal cortex. Focused tDCS modulation of this specific self-regulation network could probably be used during the first phase of nicotine abstinence, during which negative affect might easily result in relapse. These findings have implications for neuroscience models of self-regulation and are of relevance for the development of brain stimulation based treatment methods for neuropsychiatric disorders associated with self-regulation deficits.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan Neuroscience Society.",Neuroscience Research,01-Feb-15

This fMRI study investigates whether subjects at early stages of stimulant use show altered decision making processing. Method(s): 158 occasional stimulants users (OSU) and 50 comparison subjects (CS) performed a ""risky gains"" decision making task during which they could select safe options (cash in 20 cents) or gamble them for double or nothing in two consecutive gambles (win or lose 40 or 80 cents, ""risky decisions""). The primary analysis focused on risky versus safe decisions. Three secondary analyses were conducted: First, a robust regression examined the effect of lifetime exposure to stimulants and marijuana; second, subgroups of OSU with >1000 (n = 42), or <50 lifetime marijuana uses (n = 32), were compared to CS with <50 lifetime uses (n = 46) to examine potential marijuana effects; third, brain activation associated with behavioral adjustment following monetary losses was probed. Result(s): There were no behavioral differences between groups. OSU showed attenuated activation across risky and safe decisions in prefrontal cortex, insula, and dorsal striatum, exhibited lower anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsal striatum activation for risky decisions and greater inferior frontal gyrus activation for safe decisions. Those OSU with relatively more stimulant use showed greater dorsal ACC and posterior insula attenuation. In comparison, greater lifetime marijuana use was associated with less neural differentiation between risky and safe decisions. OSU who chose more safe responses after losses exhibited similarities with CS relative to those preferring risky options. Discussion(s): Individuals at risk for the development of stimulant use disorders presented less differentiated neural processing of risky and safe options. Specifically, OSU show attenuated brain response in regions critical for performance monitoring, reward processing and interoceptive awareness. Marijuana had additive effects by diminishing neural risk differentiation.Copyright © 2015 Reske et al.

treatment indication","Optogenetics has enabled the characterization of the neural circuits involved in brain diseases, such as addiction, depression or obsessive compulsive disorders. Recently, the technique has also been used to propose blueprints for novel treatments aiming at restoring circuit function through the reversal of specific forms of synaptic plasticity. Since optogenetic manipulations cannot be immediately translated to human use, we argue that an intermediate strategy could consist of emulating optogenetic protocols with deep brain stimulation (DBS). This translational path to rational, optogenetically inspired DBS protocols starts by refining existing approaches and carries the hope to expand to novel indications.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Current Opinion in Neurobiology,01-Dec-15

treatment response","Background: It has been proposed that therapeutic responses to naltrexone in alcoholism are moderated by variation at the mu-opioid receptor gene locus (OPRM1). This remains controversial because human results vary and no prospectively genotyped studies have been reported. We generated humanized mice carrying the respective human OPRM1 A118G alleles. Here, we used this model system to examine the role of OPRM1 A118G variation for opioid antagonist effects on alcohol responses. Method(s): Effects of naltrexone on alcohol reward were examined using intracranial self-stimulation. Effects of naltrexone or nalmefene on alcohol intake were examined in continuous access home cage two-bottle free-choice drinking and operant alcohol self-administration paradigms. Result(s): Alcohol lowered brain stimulation reward thresholds in 118GG mice in a manner characteristic of rewarding drugs, and this effect was blocked by naltrexone. Brain stimulation reward thresholds were unchanged by alcohol or naltrexone in 118AA mice. In the home cage, increased alcohol intake emerged in 118GG mice with increasing alcohol concentrations and was 33% higher at 17% alcohol. At this concentration, naltrexone selectively suppressed alcohol intake in 118GG animals to a level virtually identical to that of 118AA mice. No effect of naltrexone was found in the latter group. Similarly, both naltrexone and nalmefene were more effective in suppressing operant alcohol self-administration in 118GG mice. Conclusion(s): In a model that allows close experimental control, OPRM1 A118G variation robustly moderates effects of opioid antagonism on alcohol reward and consumption. These findings strongly support a personalized medicine approach to alcoholism treatment that takes into account OPRM1 genotype.Copyright © 2015 Society of Biological Psychiatry.",Biological Psychiatry,15-May-15

It is capable of delivering burst stimulation, which is a novel waveform that consists of closely spaced high-frequency electrical impulses delivered in packets riding on a plateau, and followed by a quiescent period. Its inception was based on mimicking burst firing in the nervous system and usually delivered by unmyelinated fibers that uniformly have a motivational affective homeostatic function. It thereby targets a multimodal salience network, even though the stimuli are delivered at the level of the spinal cord. As such, it is specifically capable of influencing the affective/attentional components of pain. Burst stimulation was initially safely applied off-label to the auditory cortex for tinnitus, and later also to the spinal cord, the somatosensory cortex for neuropathic pain, subcutaneously for failed back surgery syndrome, and cingulate cortex for addiction and tinnitus.Copyright © 2014 Informa UK, Ltd.",Expert Review of Medical Devices,01-Mar-15

visual stimulation","Smoking leads to the development of automatic tendencies that promote approach behavior toward smoking-related stimuli which in turn may maintain addictive behavior. The present study examined whether automatic approach tendencies toward smoking-related stimuli can be measured by using an adapted version of the Approach-Avoidance Task (AAT). Given that progression of addictive behavior has been associated with a decreased reactivity of the brain reward system for stimuli signaling natural rewards, we also used the AAT to measure approach behavior toward natural rewarding stimuli in smokers. During the AAT, 92 smokers and 51 non-smokers viewed smoking-related vs. non-smoking-related pictures and pictures of natural rewards (i.e. highly palatable food) vs. neutral pictures. They were instructed to ignore image content and to respond to picture orientation by either pulling or pushing a joystick. Within-group comparisons revealed that smokers showed an automatic approach bias exclusively for smoking-related pictures. Contrary to our expectations, there was no difference in smokers' and non-smokers' approach bias for nicotine-related stimuli, indicating that non-smokers also showed approach tendencies for this picture category. Yet, in contrast to non-smokers, smokers did not show an approach bias for foodrelated pictures. Moreover, self-reported smoking attitude could not predict approach-avoidance behavior toward nicotine-related pictures in smokers or non-smokers. Our findings indicate that the AAT is suited for measuring smoking-related approach tendencies in smokers. Furthermore, we provide evidence for a diminished approach tendency toward food-related stimuli in smokers, suggesting a decreased sensitivity to natural rewards in the course of nicotine addiction. Our results indicate that in contrast to similar studies conducted in alcohol, cannabis and heroin users, the AAT might only be partially suited for measuring smoking-related approach tendencies in smokers. Nevertheless, our findings are of special importance for current etiological models and smoking cessation programs aimed at modifying nicotine-related approach tendencies in the context of a nicotine addiction.Copyright © 2015 Machulska et al.",PLoS ONE,18-Feb-15

vagus nerve stimulation","Depression is a presenting symptom of common psychiatric disorders such as major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. Depression can also be the presenting symptom of several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, frontotemporal dementia, and Parkinson disease. Depression can also cause cognitive impairment and is a risk factor for dementia. As a result of the intimate relationship between depression and dementia, differentiating between a psychiatric and a neurologic cause of depression and dementia can sometimes be very difficult. The purpose of this review is to discuss the diagnosis and treatment of depression and to demonstrate how new diagnostic tools are helping to identify the differential diagnosis of depression. Recent Findings: It is a time of great advancement in the management of depression. Innovative new medications, psychotherapeutic modalities, and new and investigational somatic treatments (eg, transcranial magnetic stimulation, deep brain stimulation) are making it possible to ameliorate and manage symptoms more effectively in more patients. Summary: With our greater ability to improve the lives of patients with depression, it is important for neurologists to recognize depression and work with our psychiatric colleagues to help patients access the newest and best treatments.Copyright © 2015 by the American Academy of Neurology.",CONTINUUM Lifelong Learning in Neurology,05-Jun-15

visual stimulation","Objectives: Behavioral addictions (BA) are complex disorders for which pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments have shown their limits. Non-invasive brain stimulation, among which transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), has opened up new perspectives in addiction treatment. The purpose of this work is to conduct a critical and systematic review of tDCS efficacy, and of technical and methodological considerations in the field of BA. Method(s): A bibliographic search has been conducted on the Medline and ScienceDirect databases until December 2014, based on the following selection criteria: clinical studies on tDCS and BA (namely eating disorders, compulsive buying, Internet addiction, pathological gambling, sexual addiction, sports addiction, video games addiction). Study selection, data analysis, and reporting were conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines. Result(s): Out of 402 potential articles, seven studies were selected. So far focusing essentially on abnormal eating, these studies suggest that tDCS (right prefrontal anode/left prefrontal cathode) reduces food craving induced by visual stimuli. Conclusion(s): Despite methodological and technical differences between studies, the results are promising. So far, only few studies of tDCS in BA have been conducted. New research is recommended on the use of tDCS in BA, other than eating disorders.Copyright © 2015 Sauvaget, Trojak, Bulteau, Jimenez-Murcia, Fernandez-Aranda, Wolz, Menchon, Achab, Vanelle and Grall-Bronnec.",Frontiers in Neuroscience,2015

Review

sleep disorder

symptomatology","In recent years, levodopa-induced behavioral changes have received increased attention in the medical literature and in clinical practice. The spectrum of these symptoms includes non-motor fluctuations with neuropsychiatric symptoms, compulsive behaviors such as punding, dopamine dysregulation syndrome, and impulse control disorders, psychosis and hallucinations, as well as hypomania and mania. Despite knowledge of the clinical features associated with these behaviors, many of them are probably underdiagnosed. Although the mechanisms underlying behavioral symptoms are still incompletely understood, recent data from imaging and pathological studies have increased our understanding and guided new treatment strategies. Appropriate management remains challenging, because reduction of levodopa (l-dopa) and dopaminergic treatment is often recommended; however, doses required for control of motor symptoms may still induce behavioral changes. Newer modes of delivery of dopaminergic treatment, deep brain stimulation, and nondopaminergic agents may either provide alternatives for treatment of these behavioral problems or permit treatment of parkinsonism with less risk of these behavioral disorders.Copyright © 2014 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",Movement Disorders,01-Jan-15

ventromedial prefrontal cortex","Modulating neuronal activity by electrical stimulation has expanded from the realm of motor indications into the field of psychiatric disorders in the past 10 years. The medial forebrain bundle (MFB), with a seminal role in motor, reward orientated and affect regulation behaviors, and its afferent and efferent loci, have been targeted in several DBS trials in patients with psychiatric disorders. However, little is known about the consequences of modulating the MFB in affective disorders. The paper reviews the relevant pre-clinical literature investigating electrical stimulation of regions associated with the MFB in the context of several models of psychiatric disorders, in particular depression. The clinical data is promising but limited, and pre-clinical studies are essential for improved understanding of the anatomy, the connectivity, and the consequences of stimulation of the MFB and regions associated with the neurocircuitry of psychiatric disorders. Current data suggests that the MFB is at a ""privileged"" position on this circuitry and its stimulation can simultaneously modulate activity at other key sites, such as the nucleus accumbens, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex or the ventral tegmental area. Future experimental work will need to shed light on the anti-depressive mechanisms of MFB stimulation in order to optimize clinical interventions.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews,01-Feb-15

thalamus intralaminar nucleus","There is increasing interest among functional neurosurgeons in the potential for novel therapies to impact upon diseases beyond movement disorders and pain. A target of increasing interest is the nucleus accumbens (NAc), which has long been studied as a key brain region mediating a variety of behaviors, including reward and satisfaction. As such, focal modulation of the biology of the NAc with deep brain stimulation or novel biological therapies such as gene therapy or cell transplantation could have a major impact upon disorders such as depression and drug addiction. In order to both develop appropriate therapies and then deliver them in an effective fashion, a thorough understanding of the biology, physiology, and anatomy of the NAc is critical. Here, we review the existing literature regarding several areas critical to the development of new therapies, including the known pharmacology, physiology, and connectivity of the NAc, as well as evidence supporting the potential for various NAc surgical therapies in animal models. We then review the relevant anatomy of the NAc, with particular attention to the surgical anatomy, imaging, and targeting necessary to facilitate a proper localization and delivery of new agents to this region. The NAc is a fascinating and potentially rich target for stereotactic neurosurgical intervention, and analysis of existing information regarding all aspects of this structure should help potentiate therapeutic advances and reduce complications from future studies of neurosurgical intervention in this region for a variety of disorders.Copyright © 2015 S.

The development of a unified testing approach is crucial prior to initiating individual studies to address abuse potential. The core preclinical studies that will be required include a dependence/withdrawal study, an assessment of the discriminative cue produced by the new drug, and an assessment of whether the drug will be self-administered. This discussion is focused on the requirements for drug scheduling recommendations from the FDA and how to conduct the evaluations that will be used to make those recommendations and how to select parameter details such as preclinical species, test doses, test conditions, route of drug administration, comparator compounds, and behavioral test designs recommended.Copyright © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.",,2015

Recently, the technique has also been used to propose blueprints for novel treatments of these diseases. For many reasons, optogenetics cannot be applied to humans applications anytime soon; we therefore argue that an intermediate step would be novel deep brain stimulation (DBS) protocols that emulate successful optogenetic <<treatments>> in animal models. Here we provide a roadmap of a translational path to rational, opto gene tically inspired DBS protocols to refine existing approaches and expand it to novel indications.",Revue Medicale Suisse,29-Apr-15

treatment planning","Drug addiction is a serious problem all over the world involving both medical and social issues. The treatment strategy lies in two aspects, promoting detoxification and preventing relapse. The latter is the key for successful treatment. Although surgical measures, like stereotactic ablation of nucleus accumbens (NAc), had already been proven to be effective for relapse prevention clinically, the application was restricted because of the damage to brain tissues. Deep brain stimulation (DBS), which had been successfully applied in movement disorders, was recently performed in addiction studies on both animals and humankind. Among numbers of brain areas related to addiction, NAc is the hottest target studied and may bring better clinical effect. In addition, combining stimulation of multiple brain targets is currently performed for relapse prevention. The mechanism of DBS for treatment of addiction remains unclear right now, however, DBS may be an experimental method to treat refractory addictive patients. Certainly, lots of problems need to be solved in large sample study before the wide application of DBS for addiction treatment, such as the setting of stimulation parameters, recognition of objective treatment feedback and ethical issues.Copyright © 2015 by the Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Contemporary Neurology and Neurosurgery.",Chinese Journal of Contemporary Neurology and Neurosurgery,25-Oct-15

withdrawal syndrome / side effect","The introduction of dopamine agonists was a welcome development in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. However, their history has been somewhat checkered with concerns about their side effects including sudden onset of sleep and 'sleep attacks' the development of fibrotic side effects with ergot-derived agents; and most recently, the emergence of impulse control disorders. Furthermore, those who develop these behaviors are those most likely to suffer distressing side effects on their withdrawal: the so-called 'dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome' (DAWS). This review examines this complex area and some suggested strategies to avoid and manage these phenomena, and concludes with some discussion of the future agenda for improving the understanding and management of these conditions.Copyright © 2015 Future Medicine Ltd.",Future Neurology,01-Jul-15

This study is a largely pictorial description of the deep fiber tracts in the brain using track-density images obtained with 7.0-T diffusion-weighted imaging. Methods To identify the fiber tracts, we selected 3 sets of tractograms and performed interaxis correlation between them. These tractograms offered an opportunity to extract new information in areas that have previously been difficult to examine using either in vivo or in vitro human brain tractography. Results With this new technique, we identified 4 fiber tracts that have not previously been directly visualized in vivo: septum pellucidum tract, anterior thalamic radiation, superolateral medial forebrain bundle, and inferomedial forebrain bundle. Conclusions We present the high-resolution images as a tool for researchers and clinicians working with neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases, such as Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, and depression, in which the accurate positioning of deep brain stimulation is essential for precise targeting of nuclei and fiber tracts.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In this exploratory study, we investigate the emergence, trends, and connections of topics within the whole text corpus of the deep brain stimulation (DBS) literature based on more than 7000 papers (title and abstracts) published between 1991 to 2014 using a network approach. Taking the co-occurrence of basic terms that represent important topics within DBS as starting point, we outline the statistics of interconnections between DBS indications, anatomical targets, positive, and negative effects, as well as methodological, technological, and economic issues. This quantitative approach confirms known trends within the literature (e.g., regarding the emergence of psychiatric indications). The data also reflect an increased discussion about complex issues such as personality connected tightly to the ethical context, as well as an apparent focus on depression as important DBS indication, where the co-occurrence of terms related to negative effects is low both for the indication as well as the related anatomical targets. We also discuss consequences of the analysis from a bioethical perspective, i.e., how such a quantitative analysis could uncover hidden subject matters that have ethical relevance. For example, we find that hardware-related issues in DBS are far more robustly connected to an ethical context compared to impulsivity, concrete side-effects or death/suicide. Our contribution also outlines the methodology of quantitative text analysis that combines statistical approaches with expert knowledge. It thus serves as an example how innovative quantitative tools can be made useful for gaining a better understanding in the field of DBS.Copyright © 2015 Ineichen and Christen.",Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience,26-Oct-15

Several studies suggest that different neurotrasmitters, within the corticolimbic system, are critically involved in the processing of positive and negative stimuli. Individual differences in this system, depending on genotype, have been shown to act as a liability factor for different psychopathologies. Inbred mouse strains are commonly used in preclinical studies of normal and pathological behaviors. In particular, C57BL/6J (C57) and DBA/2J (DBA) strains have permitted to disclose the impact of different genetic backgrounds over the corticolimbic system functions. Here, we summarize the main findings collected over the years in our laboratory, showing how the genetic background plays a critical role in modulating amminergic and GABAergic neurotransmission in prefrontal-accumbal-amygdala system response to different rewarding and aversive experiences, as well as to stress response. Finally, we propose a top-down model for the response to rewarding and aversive stimuli in which amminergic transmission in prefrontal cortex (PFC) controls accumbal and amygdala neurotransmitter response.Copyright © 2015 Andolina, Puglisi-Allegra and Ventura.",Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience,04-Feb-15

It is neurochemically and immunohistochemically divided into a shell laterally and a core medially. As a functionally central structure between amygdala, basal ganglia, mesolimbic dopaminergic regions, mediodorsal thalamus and prefrontal cortex, the nucleus accumbens appears to play a modulative role in the flow of the information from the amygdaloid complex to these regions. Dopamine is a major neurotransmitter of the nucleus accumbens and this nucleus has a modulative function to the amygdala-basal ganglia-prefrontal cortex circuit. Together with the prefrontal cortex and amygdala, nucleus accumbens consists a part of the cerebral circuit which regulates functions associated with effort. It is anatomically located in a unique way to serve emotional and behavioral components of feelings. It is considered as a neural interface between motivation and action, having a key-role in food intake, sexual behavior, reward-motivated behavior, stress-related behavior and substance-dependence. It is involved in several cognitive, emotional and psychomotor functions, altered in some psychopathology. Moreover it is involved in some of the commonest and most severe psychiatric disorders, such as depression, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder and other anxiety disorders, as well as in addiction, including drugs abuse, alcoholism and smoking. Nucleus accumbens has also a role in other psychiatric disorders such as bipolar disorder, attention deficit/ hyperactivity disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. Because of its rich dopaminergic projections, this nucleus has been subject of many studies in animals as well as in humans, connecting its malfunction with the disturbed reward process observed in depression. Neuromodulation interventions targeting the nucleus accumbens are nowadays applied in strictly selected patients suffering from treatment-resistant depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, Tourette syndrome and addiction to drugs or alcohol. Specifically, bilateral and unilateral (right) deep brain stimulation of the nucleus accumbens has been applied in obsessive-compulsive patients resulting into significant improvement of their symptoms and their quality of life. Nucleus accumbens deep brain stimulation has been also associated with antidepressant and anxiolytic effect, as well as quality of life improvement in patients suffering from severe resistant depression. Finally, this minimally invasive stereotactic procedure has been proved beneficial for all phenotypic components of the Tourette syndrome, with remarkable reduction of the syndrome's motor manifestations, including tics.",Psychiatrike = Psychiatriki,01-Oct-15

While bariatric surgery has been shown to be successful for treatment of morbid obesity for those who have undergone unsuccessful behavioral modification, its associated risks and rates of relapse are not insignificant. There exists a neurological basis for the binge-like feeding behavior observed in morbid obesity that is believed to be due to dysregulation of the reward circuitry. The authors present a review of the evidence of the neuroanatomical basis for obesity, the potential neural targets for deep brain stimulation (DBS), as well as a rationale for DBS and future trial design. Identification of an appropriate patient population that would most likely benefit from this type of therapy is essential. There are also significant cost and ethical considerations for such a neuromodulatory intervention designed to alter maladaptive behavior.

More recently this technique has been proposed for the treatment of drug addiction, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and dementia. The nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and hippocampus, central nuclei within the limbic system, have been studied as potential targets for neuromodulation for the treatment of drug addiction, PTSD, and dementia, respectively. As the scope of neuromodulation grows to include disorders of mood and thought, new ethical and philosophic challenges that require multidisciplinary discussion and cooperation are emerging.

Material and Methods: This review is based on the experience of the Functional Neurosurgery group of the Hospital Santa Maria (Centro Hospitalar de Lisboa Norte) since 1995 and on the bibliography published since 1980 indexed on PubMed.
Results and Discussion: The deep brain stimulation applications in the different functional neurosciences fields are presented and discussed: Movement disorders, including Parkinson's disease, dystonia and tremor, Gilles de la Tourette, chronic pain, epilepsy and psychosurgery with its different aims: Obsessive-compulsive disorder, severe resistant depression, resistant aggressiveness with disruptive behavior, eating behavior disorders (anorexia nervosa, morbid obesity) and drug addiction (alcohol, opioids, cocaine).
Conclusions: In most of these clinical situations, deep brain stimulation is a safe and useful therapeutic resource that must be considered whenever the usual therapies are useless or not enough; in the other cases a greater experience is needed to make it a regular indication.Copyright © Ordem dos Medicos 2014.",Acta Medica Portuguesa,01-Sep-14

Fortunately, technical limitations that have constrained this research have recently been mitigated by advances in research tools that facilitate circuit-based analyses. The most prominent of these tools is optogenetics, which refers to the use of genetically encoded, light-sensitive proteins that can be used to manipulate discrete neural circuits with temporal precision. Optogenetics has recently been used to examine the neural underpinnings of both psychiatric disease and symptom relief, and this research has rapidly identified novel therapeutic targets for what could be a new generation of rational drug development. As these and related methodologies for controlling neurons ultimately make their way into the clinic, circuit-based strategies for alleviating psychiatric symptoms could become a remarkably refined approach to disease treatment. © 2014 McDevitt et al.

As an established treatment for movement disorders, the application of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for psychiatric indications has been investigated for almost 15 years. A CE label (also FDA approval) has recently been obtained for treatment of refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Objectives. This article aims at illustrating the current state of DBS in the treatment of refractory OCD. In addition, initial experimental approaches to investigate the potential use of DBS in substance addiction and anorexia nervosa (AN) will also be outlined as both disorders share some common features with OCD. Materials and methods. The present review is based on a keyword literature search (PubMed) while taking into account relevant references and own investigations Although the number of clinical trials for treatment of refractory OCD is limited and sample sizes are small, there is some evidence for a substantial improvement, a so-called full response of OCD symptoms under DBS. However, not all patients benefit from the intervention. Regarding substance addiction and AN, data are scarce and are only indicative of a potential benefit at most. Discussion. Present data regarding the clinical benefits of DBS in OCD are encouraging and open up new avenues for the treatment of therapy refractory patients. However, several aspects, such as mechanisms of action, predictors and long-term side effect profiles, are incomplete or even unknown. In the case of addiction and AN, DBS remains purely experimental, at least for the moment. Hence, clinical trials should remain the gold standard for all three indications. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.",Nervenarzt,Feb-14

Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale","Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has been linked to reward dysfunctions, highlighting a possible role of anhedonia in OCD. Surprisingly, anhedonia in OCD has never been evaluated. Moreover, although nicotine typically has anti-anhedonic effects, anecdotal reports suggest low prevalence rates of smoking in OCD. To address these two phenomena, 113 individuals with OCD completed a battery of questionnaires assessing symptom severity, anhedonia, and smoking. 28.3% of the sample met criteria for clinically significant anhedonia, which correlated with Y-BOCS scores (r=0.44), even when controlling for depressive symptoms. 13.3% of the sample endorsed current smoking, a lower rate than seen in psychiatric disorders (40-90%) and the general adult population (19%). Results highlight high rates of anhedonia and yet reduced prevalence of smoking in OCD. In contrast to the known positive association between anhedonia and smoking, a negative association emerged. Future research is needed to address the unique interface between anhedonia and reward responsiveness in OCD.

This article reviews data from studies on human participants and animal models showing how electrical stimulation in deep brain structures (deep brain stimulation) can influence autonomic function. What advances does it highlight? Focusing on the control of the cardiovascular system and bladder function, it highlights the potential for development of deep brain stimulation as a new treatment option for patients with autonomic dysfunction. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) in humans has come of age as a tool to treat movement disorders including Parkinson's disease tremor and dystonia as well as a panoply of other disease states including headache, epilepsy, obesity, eating disorders, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, Tourette's syndrome, addiction and chronic pain. Increasingly, practitioners of DBS are reporting autonomic side effects, which intriguingly, sometimes result in improved autonomic function. Focussing on the effects of stimulation at periaqueductal and periventricular sites on cardiovascular function and control of micturition, this review shows that data obtained from studies in animals is now being confirmed in humans. Lowering of blood pressure and improved baroreflex function can be evoked in humans by DBS at these midbrain sites as well as increased bladder capacity. The findings highlight the tantalizing possibility that DBS could be developed for treatment of dysfunctional autonomic states in humans. © 2013 The Author.

Our previous work showed that damage to the insula disrupted addiction to cigarette smoking-the first time that the insula was shown to be a critical neural substrate for addiction. Here, we review those findings, as well as more recent studies that corroborate and extend them, demonstrating the role of the insula in (1) incentive motivational processes that drive addictive behavior, (2) control processes that moderate or inhibit addictive behavior, and (3) interoceptive processes that represent bodily states associated with drug use. We then describe a theoretical framework that attempts to integrate these seemingly disparate findings. In this framework, the insula functions in the recall of interoceptive drug effects during craving and drug seeking under specific conditions where drug taking is perceived as risky and/or where there is conflict between drug taking and more adaptive goals. We describe this framework in an evolutionary context and discuss its implications for understanding the mechanisms of behavior change in addiction treatments. © 2014 New York Academy of Sciences.",,May-14

Prefrontal cortical microcircuits are assumed to play a key role in the perception to action cycle that integrates relevant information about environment, and then selects and enacts behavioural responses. Thus, neurons within the interlaminar microcircuits participate in various functional states requiring the integration of signals across cortical layers and the selection of executive variables. Recent research suggests that executive abilities emerge from cortico-cortical interactions between interlaminar prefrontal cortical microcircuits, whereas their disruption is involved in a broad spectrum of neurologic and psychiatric disorders such as autism, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's and drug addiction. The focus of this review is on the structural, functional and pathological approaches involving cortical minicolumns. Based on recent technological progress it has been demonstrated that microstimulation of infragranular cortical layers with patterns of microcurrents derived from supragranular layers led to an increase in cognitive performance. This suggests that interlaminar prefrontal cortical microcircuits are playing a causal role in improving cognitive performance. An important reason for the new interest in cortical modularity comes from both the impressive progress in understanding anatomical, physiological and pathological facets of cortical microcircuits and the promise of neural prosthetics for patients with neurological and psychiatric disorders. © 2014 The Author.",Brain,Jul-14

To date, few data are available on DDS risk factors, cognitive profile and long-term outcome. Methods In this retrospective case-control study, consecutive PD outpatients fulfilling criteria for DDS were assessed over a 6-year period (2005-2011). They were compared with 70 PD cases matched for age at onset, gender and disease duration, and with 1281 subjects with motor fluctuations and dyskinesias. DDS patients and matched controls underwent extensive neuropsychological assessment. Strategies for DDS patients management and the outcome at the last follow-up visit were recorded. Results Thirty-five patients with DDS were identified, reporting history of depression, family history of PD and drug abuse, greater difference between 'Off' versus 'On' motor symptoms compared to age-matched controls. They had younger age at onset (but not any gender difference) compared to general PD population. Cognitive profile of DDS did not show major abnormalities, including executive functions. DDS patients have been followed up for 3.2+/-2.1 years and remission was recorded in 40% of cases. Negative DDS outcome was significantly associated with poor caregiver supervision. Sustained remission occurred more commonly on clozapine and on duodenal levodopa infusion and subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) than on apomorphine pump treatment. Conclusions Clinicians should be aware of risk factors predisposing to DDS. Duodenal levodopa infusion and, less consistently, STN-DBS were more commonly associated with DDS remission. Effective caregiving plays a key role in long-term behavioural outcome.","Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry",Mar-14

Because of the limited research in this area, all studies (including case reports) that evaluated the therapeutic use of rTMS in nicotine, alcohol, or illicit drug addiction were included in this review. Papers published prior to December 2012 were found through an NCBI PubMed search. A total of eleven studies were identified that met review criteria.There is nascent evidence that rTMS could be effective in reducing cocaine craving and nicotine and alcohol craving and consumption and might represent a potential therapeutic tool for treating addiction. Further studies are needed to identify the optimal parameters of stimulation for the most effective treatment of drug addiction, to improve our comprehension of the treatment neurophysiological effects, and to conduct rigorous, controlled efficacy studies with adequate power.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) technology is the preferred tool in the current wave of clinical experiments because it allows clinicians to directly alter the functions of targeted brain regions, in a reversible manner, with the intent of correcting diseases of the mind, such as depression, addiction, anorexia nervosa, dementia, and obsessive compulsive disorder. These promising treatments raise a critical philosophical and humanitarian question. ""Under what conditions does 'altering brain function' qualify as 'mind control'?"" In order to answer this question one needs a definition of mind control. To this end, we reviewed the relevant philosophical, ethical, and neurosurgical literature in order to create a set of criteria for what constitutes mind control in the context of DBS. We also outline clinical implications of these criteria. Finally, we demonstrate the relevance of the proposed criteria by focusing especially on serendipitous treatments involving DBS, i.e., cases in which an unintended therapeutic benefit occurred. These cases highlight the importance of gaining the consent of the subject for the new therapy in order to avoid committing an act of mind control.Copyright © 2014 Koivuniemi and Otto.",Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience,14-Oct-14

The combination of innovative approaches to neural interface technology with novel target identification based on previously discovered clinical effects of lesioning procedures has led to a fundamental paradigm for new directions in the application of DBS. The historical use of neurosurgical lesioning procedures in the treatment of psychiatric diseases such as obsessive compulsive disorder provided an initial opportunity to expand the use of DBS. The list is rapidly expanding and now includes major depressive disorder, Tourette's syndrome, addiction disorders, and eating disorders. Keen observations by neurosurgeons using these devices have lead to the incidental discovery of treatments for diseases without previous neurosurgical treatments. These discoveries are breaking new ground in the treatment of disorders of cognition, headache syndromes, disorders of consciousness, and epilepsy. Two features of DBS make it well-suited for treatment of disorders of nervous system function. First, the reversible, nonlesional nature of DBS allows for investigation of new targets without the morbidity of permanent side effects. Second, the programmable nature of DBS allows practitioners to alter stimulation patterns to minimize side effects and potentially improve efficacy through reprogramming. More importantly, proper scientific evaluation of new targets is aided by the ability to turn stimulation on and off with evaluators blinded to the stimulation status. Knowledge of these emerging therapies is important for practitioners, as there are many situations where a single target can effectively treat the symptoms of more than one disease. The intersection of advances in neuromodulation, neurophysiology, neuroimaging, and functional neuroanatomy has created an environment rife with new therapeutic possibilities.",Journal of Neurosurgical Sciences,01-Dec-14

Poor response inhibition may constitute one facet of impulsivity. Trait impulsivity can be assessed by self-report questionnaires such as the widely used Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11). However, regarding the multidimensionality of impulsivity different concepts have been proposed, in particular the UPPS self-report questionnaire ('Urgency', 'Lack of Premeditation', 'Lack of Perseverance', 'Sensation Seeking') that is based on a factor analytic approach. The question as to which aspects of trait impulsivity map on individual differences of the behavioral and neural correlates of response inhibition so far remains unclear.In the present study, we investigated 52 healthy individuals that scored either very high or low on the BIS-11 and underwent a reward-modulated Stop-signal task during fMRI. Neither behavioral nor neural differences were observed with respect to high- and low-BIS groups. In contrast, UPPS subdomain Urgency best explained inter-individual variability in SSRT scores and was further negatively correlated to right IFG/aI activation in 'Stop. >. Go' trials - a key region for response inhibition. Successful response inhibition in rewarded compared to nonrewarded stop trials yielded ventral striatal (VS) activation which might represent a feedback signal. Interestingly, only participants with low Urgency scores were able to use this VS feedback signal for better response inhibition.Our findings indicate that the relationship of impulsivity and response inhibition has to be treated carefully. We propose Urgency as an important subdomain that might be linked to response inhibition as well as to the use of reward-based neural signals. Based on the present results, further studies examining the influence of impulsivity on psychiatric disorders should take into account Urgency as an important modulator of behavioral adaptation.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",NeuroImage,01-Dec-14

task performance","The frequency and intensity of alcohol consumption episodes has rapidly increased among adolescents and young adults during the last decade. Particularly, binge drinking habits, globally defined as an alcohol consumption pattern characterized by excessive but episodic alcohol intakes with an alternation between intense intoxications episodes and withdrawal periods, have recently expanded towards younger populations. These alcohol-related problems in youth are now considered as a central public health concern in Western countries. The psychological, interpersonal and social problems associated with binge drinking are now well established, but the cerebral correlates of this habit remain poorly understood. Animal studies have suggested that binge drinking might rapidly lead to large-scale cerebral impairments, notably because the immature adolescent brain is particularly sensitive to alcohol effects and because the repeated alternation between intoxications and withdrawals is particularly deleterious for the brain. However, this proposal has up to now received only limited support from human studies. On the basis of a precise definition of binge drinking, the present paper thus centrally aims at reviewing the current knowledge concerning brain impairments observed among binge drinkers, and at proposing a potential research agenda to favour the development of this topic in the following years. Recent data obtained by means of neuropsychological, electrophysiological and neuroimaging techniques will first be presented, before identifying the crucial yet still underexplored questions to be investigated in this research field, and particularly: (1) the specificity of the deficits for binge drinking as compared to other alcohol consumption patterns; (2) the age and gender variations concerning the brain effects related to excessive alcohol consumption; (3) the causal link between cerebral impairments and binge drinking habits, with the proposal that some brain changes might precede the appearance of binge drinking; (4) the continuity between the successive stages of alcohol-related problems, from alcohol abuse in binge drinking to alcohol-dependence; (5) the proposal that a cerebral compensation might take place in the first stages of binge drinking, some brain regions being activated during cognitive tasks to compensate for altered activations in other brain areas. Finally, the major implications that could be allowed by a better understanding of this issue at theoretical and clinical points of view will be underlined. A particular emphasis will be put on the critical need to rapidly develop a combined neuroscience approach in order to further identify the structural and functional effects of binge drinking habits on the brain. © 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.",Neuropsychiatrie de l'Enfance et de l'Adolescence,May-14

The habenula is a small brain structure located posterior to the thalamus and adjacent to the third ventricle. Despite its small size, the habenula can be divided into medial habenula (MHb) and lateral habenula (LHb) nuclei that are anatomically and transcriptionally distinct. The habenula receives inputs from the limbic system and basal ganglia primarily via the stria medullaris. The fasciculus retroflexus is the primary habenular output from the habenula to the midbrain and governs release of glutamate onto gabaergic cells in the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg) and onto the interpeduncular nucleus. The resulting GABA released from RMTg neurons inactivates dopaminergic cells in the ventral tegmental area/substantia nigra compacta. Through this process, the habenula controls dopamine levels in the striatum. Thus, the habenula plays a critical role in reward and reward-associated learning. The LHb also modulates serotonin levels and norepinephrine release, while the MHb modulates acetylcholine. The habenula is a critical crossroad that influences the brain's response to pain, stress, anxiety, sleep, and reward. Dysfunction of the habenula has been linked to depression, schizophrenia, and the effects of drugs of abuse. This review focuses on the possible relationships between the habenula and drug abuse. © 2014 Velasquez, Molfese and Salas.",Frontiers in Human Neuroscience,28-Mar-14

reward","Purpose of review: This article provides an overview of current thinking about the association between disordered eating and obesity, emphasizing binge eating, binge eating disorder and food addiction as useful conceptual models. Recent findings: Binge eating, recurrent and persistent episodes of overeating coupled with a lack of control over eating, and binge eating disorder, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-5 mental disorder, have been a major focus of work to clarify the relationship between disordered eating and obesity. A second focus has been the addiction model of aberrant eating, which posits that recurrent overeating of palatable food is similar to addictive behavior and characterized by dysregulation of the dopaminergic reward system. We describe efforts to integrate these models by focusing on binge eating phenotypes as the subgroup of obese individuals characterized by disordered eating. Examples of empirical work based on these models are provided, as well as selected studies that reflect the burgeoning literature focusing on addictive and feeding behaviors across multiple domains and levels of analysis. Summary: Research evidence to explain similarities and differences across levels of BMI and varying aspects of feeding behavior may promote the identification of novel interventions that address weight and eating problems.Copyright © 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health  Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.",Current Opinion in Psychiatry,2014

subthalamic nucleus","Background: Impulsive and compulsive behaviors (ICBs) are a heterogeneous group of conditions that may be caused by long-term dopaminergic replacement therapy (DRT) of Parkinson's disease (PD). The spectrum of ICBs includes dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS), punding and impulsive control disorders (ICDs). Contents: We made a detailed review regarding the epidemiology, pathology, clinical characteristics, risk factors, diagnosis as well as treatment of ICBs. Result(s): The prevalence of ICBs in PD patients is approximately 3-4% for DDS, 0.34-4.2% for punding and 6-14% for ICDs, with higher prevalence in Western populations than in Asian. Those who take high dose of Levodopa are more prone to have DDS, whereas ICDs are markedly associated with dopamine agonists (DAs). Different subtypes of ICBs share many risk factors such as male gender, higher Levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD), younger age at PD onset, history of alcoholism, impulsive or novelty-seeking personality. The Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorder in Parkinson's Disease-Rating Scale (QUIP-RS) seems to be a rather efficacious instrument to obtain relevant information from patients and caregivers. Treatment of ICBs is still a great challenge for clinicians. Readjustment of DRT remains the primary method. Atypical antipsychotics, antidepressants, amantadine, and psychosocial interventions are also prescribed in controlling episodes of psychosis caused by compulsive DRT, but attention should be drawn to balance ICBs symptoms and motor disorders. Moreover, deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) might be a potential method in controlling ICBs. Conclusion(s): The exact pathophysiological mechanisms of ICBs in PD remains poorly understood. Further researches are needed not only to study the pathogenesis, prevalence, features and risk factors of ICBs, but to find efficacious therapy for patients with these devastating consequences.Copyright © 2014 Zhang, Zhang, Liu, Yang, Huang, Xiong and Wang.",Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience,2014

We explore the neuroscientific basis of aberrant reward in AN, with the aim of generating novel hypotheses for translational investigation, and elucidate disease mechanisms to inform the development of targeted interventions. Relevant neuroimaging and behavioural studies are reviewed. These suggest that altered eating in AN may be a consequence of aberrant reward processing combined with exaggerated cognitive control. We consider evidence that such aberrant reward processing is reflected in the compulsive behaviours characterising AN, with substantial overlap in the neural circuits implicated in reward processing and compulsivity. Drawing on contemporary neuroscientific theories of substance dependence, processes underpinning the shift from the initially rewarding pursuit of thinness to extreme and compulsive weight control behaviours are discussed. It is suggested that in AN, weight loss behaviour begins as overtly rewarding, goal-directed and positively reinforced, but over time becomes habitual and increasingly negatively reinforced. Excessive habit formation is suggested as one underlying mechanism perpetuating compulsive behaviour. Ongoing research into the behavioural and neural basis of aberrant reward in AN is required to further elucidate mechanisms. We discuss clinical and transdiagnostic implications, and propose that future treatment innovation may benefit from the development of novel interventions targeting aberrant reward processing in AN.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Behaviour Research and Therapy,01-Nov-14

An aphasia treatment was designed to shift laterality from the left to right lateral frontal lobe during word production by initiating word-finding trials with complex left-hand movements. Previous findings indicated successful relateralization. Objective. The current study was designed to ascertain whether the shift was attributable to the lefthand movement. Methods. Using stratified random sampling, 14 subjects were equally divided between Intention (IT) and Control (CT) treatments. CT was identical to IT, except with no left-hand movements. Both treatments trained picture naming (phases 1 and 2) and category-member generation (phase 3), each phase lasting 10 sessions. Functional magnetic resonance imaging of category member generation occurred at pretreatment, posttreatment, and 3-month follow-up. Results. IT shifted lateral frontal activity rightward compared with pretreatment both at posttreatment (t = -2.602, df = 6, P < .05) and 3-month follow-up (t = -2.332, df = 5, P < .05), but CT did not. IT and CT yielded similar changes for all picture-naming and category probes. However, IT patients showed gains for untrained category (t = 3.33, df = 6, P < .01) and picture-naming probes (t = 3.77, df = 5, P < .01), but CT patients did not. Conclusions. The rightward shift in lateral frontal activity for IT was because of the left-hand movements. IT evoked greater generalization than CT. © The Author(s) 2013.",Neurorehabilitation and Neural Repair,July-August 2014

The treatment approaches may be widely variable and there is not much information on these syndromes in the setting of deep brain stimulation (DBS). Objective(s): To evaluate (1) ICDs, DAWS and DDS pre-and post DBS in PD and (2) to investigate pre-DBS treatment strategies regarding these behaviors among Parkinson Study Group (PSG) centers. Method(s): Forty-eight PSG centers were surveyed on ICDs, DAWS and DDS, as well as on potential relationships to DBS and treatment approaches. Result(s): Sixty-seven percent of PSG centers reported that they served a population of over 500 PD patients per year, and 94% of centers performed DBS surgery. Most centers (92%) reported screening for ICDs, DAWS and DDS. Of the centers screening for these symptoms, 13% reported always employing a formal battery of pre-operative tests, 46% of sites inconsistently used a formal battery, while 23% of sites reported never using a formal battery to screen for these symptoms. The estimated numbers of centers observing ICDs, DAWS and DDS pre-operatively in individuals with PD were 71%, 69%, and 69%, respectively. PSG DBS centers observing at least one case of a new de novo occurrence of an ICD, DAWS or DDS after DBS surgery were 67%, 65% and 65%, respectively. Conclusion(s): The results suggest that addiction-like syndromes and withdrawal syndromes are prevalent in expert PSG centers performing DBS. Most centers reported screening for these issues without the use of a formal battery, and there were a large number of centers reporting ICDs, DAWS and DDS post-DBS. A single treatment strategy did not emerge.Copyright © 2014-IOS Press and the authors.",Journal of Parkinson's Disease,2014

upregulation","A small but growing neuroimaging literature has begun to examine the neural mechanisms underlying the difficulty that substance-use dependent (SUD) groups have with ignoring salient, drug-related stimuli. Drug-related attentional bias appears to implicate the countermanding forces of cognitive control and reward salience. Basic cognitive neuroscience research suggests that ignoring emotionally evocative stimuli in our environment requires both up-regulation of control networks and down-regulation of processing in emotion and reward regions. Research to date suggests that attentional biases for drug-related stimuli emerge from a failure to sufficiently increase control of attention over salient, but task-irrelevant stimuli. While SUD samples have typically shown increased activity in the cognitive control regions (ie, lateral prefrontal and dorsal anterior cingulate), during attentional bias such increases appear to have been insufficient for the concomitant increases in processing by the emotion/reward regions (ie, amygdala, insula, and striatum). Given the potential contribution of attentional biases to perpetuating drug use and the development of interventions (both pharmaceutical and cognitive-behavioral) to treat biases, understanding the neural basis of successfully reducing bias remains an important, but as yet unanswered, question for our field.Copyright © Cambridge University Press 2013.",CNS Spectrums,2014

Preclinical models suggest that attentional bias emerges as a consequence of dopaminergic activity evoked by substance-related cues. The aim of the current review is to describe pharmacological mechanisms underlying attentional bias in humans and to critically review empirical studies that aimed to modulate attentional bias in substance-dependent patients by using pharmacological agents. The findings of the reviewed studies suggest that attentional bias and related brain activation may be modulated by dopamine. All of the reviewed studies investigated acute effects of pharmacological agents, while measurements of chronic pharmacological treatments on attentional bias and clinically relevant measures such as relapse are yet lacking. Therefore, the current findings should be interpreted as a proof of principle concerning the role of dopamine in attentional bias. At the moment, there is too little evidence for clinical applications. While the literature search was not limited to dopamine, there is a lack of studies investigating the role of non-dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems in substance-related attentional bias. A focus on neurotransmitter systems such as acetylcholine and noradrenaline could provide new insights regarding the pharmacology of substance-related attentional bias.Copyright © Cambridge University Press 2013.",CNS Spectrums,2014

Literature also provides positive results for deep brain stimulation applied in selected patients with intractable epilepsy and refractory pain. The results of deep brain stimulation in selected patients with certain refractory psychiatric disorders (e.g. treatment resistant depression and obsessive compulsive disorder) are encouraging. Deep brain stimulation was also used in small cohorts of patients with various serious refractory disorders, such as uncontrollable aggression, eating disorders, morbid obesity, vegetative state, Alzheimer disease, and drug and alcohol abuse. The paper aims to present an overview of these less frequent indications of deep brain stimulation, basic data about stimulation target structures, description of the clinical data available so far, practical surgical considerations and a short prospective of further use of deep brain stimulation in patients suffering from the serious functional problems described above.",Ceska a Slovenska Neurologie a Neurochirurgie,2014

*transcranial direct current stimulation

*transcranial magnetic stimulation","In recent years, non-pharmacologic approaches to modifying human neural activity have gained increasing attention. One of these approaches is brain stimulation, which involves either the direct application of electrical current to structures in the nervous system or the indirect application of current by means of electromagnetic induction. Interventions that manipulate the brain have generally been regarded as having both the potential to alleviate devastating brain-related conditions and the capacity to create unforeseen and unwanted consequences. Hence, although brain stimulation techniques offer considerable benefits to society, they also raise a number of ethical concerns. In this paper we will address various dilemmas related to brain stimulation in the context of clinical practice and biomedical research. We will survey current work involving deep brain stimulation, transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation. We will reflect upon relevant similarities and differences between them, and consider some potentially problematic issues that may arise within the framework of established principles of medical ethics: nonmaleficence and beneficence, autonomy, and justice. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Brain Topography,Jan-14

review","Alcohol use is typically initiated during adolescence, which, along with young adulthood, is a vulnerable period for the onset of high-risk drinking and alcohol abuse. Given across-species commonalities in certain fundamental neurobehavioral characteristics of adolescence, studies in laboratory animals such as the rat have proved useful to assess persisting consequences of repeated alcohol exposure. Despite limited research to date, reports of long-lasting effects of adolescent ethanol exposure are emerging, along with certain common themes. One repeated finding is that adolescent exposure to ethanol sometimes results in the persistence of adolescent-typical phenotypes into adulthood. Instances of adolescent-like persistence have been seen in terms of baseline behavioral, cognitive, electrophysiological and neuroanatomical characteristics, along with the retention of adolescent-typical sensitivities to acute ethanol challenge. These effects are generally not observed after comparable ethanol exposure in adulthood. Persistence of adolescent-typical phenotypes is not always evident, and may be related to regionally specific ethanol influences on the interplay between CNS excitation and inhibition critical for the timing of neuroplasticity. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews,Sep-14

Despite multiple efforts to tackle cocaine dependence, pharmacological as well as cognitive therapies have had limited success. In this review, we discuss the use of recent neuromodulation techniques, such as conventional repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), deep brain stimulation, and the use of H coils for deep rTMS for the treatment of cocaine dependence. Moreover, we discuss attempts to identify optimal brain targets underpinning cocaine craving and withdrawal for neurodisruption treatment, as well as some weaknesses in the literature, such as the absence of biomarkers for individual risk classification and the inadequacy of treatment outcome measures, which may delay progress in the field. Finally, we present some genetic markers candidates and objective outcome measures, which could be applied in combination with transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment of cocaine dependence. We anticipate future research in this area combining genetic and physiological markers, neurodisruption, and clinical behavioral measures. © 2013 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Addictive Disorders and their Treatment,Mar-14

weight reduction","Background: Several studies have examined reversibility of tardive syndromes (TS), primarily in psychotic patients who are maintained on dopamine receptor blocking drugs. The results have varied widely. However, few have assessed remission rates after discontinuing the offending agents. This study evaluated reversibility of TS in patients who permanently withdrew the causative agent(s). We also examined for any possible clinical predictors of reversibility.
Methods: A retrospective cohort of 108 TS patients was studied. Most of the patients were not psychotic; most patients were being treated either for a mood disorder with atypical antipsychotics or for a gastrointestinal disturbance with metoclopramide. Patients were stratified on the basis of reversibility, and statistical tests were used for subgroup comparisons of relevant clinical variables. Logistic regression was undertaken to identify clinical variables predictive of reversibility.
Results: Only 13% of the cohort experienced reversibility of the TS, 2% without medical intervention. When stratified by reversibility, there were no significant differences in any study variables between subgroups. None of the study variables predicted reversibility in the logistic regression.
Discussion: Our study demonstrated a low remission rate for TS in a cohort of psychiatric and non-psychiatric patients seen in a movement disorder clinic after the offending agents were completely withdrawn. Such a finding has significant prognostic implications. It is possible that limitations of the retrospective design may have resulted in an underestimation. There is a clear need for prospective, multicenter, clinical trials in populations that can be safely withdrawn from dopamine receptor blocking agents so that true remission rates can be measured.Copyright © 2014 Zutshi et al.",Tremor and Other Hyperkinetic Movements,2014

*subthalamic nucleus","Deep-brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an established treatment for motor complications in Parkinson's disease. 20 years of experience with this procedure have contributed to improved understanding of the role of the STN in motor, cognitive, and emotional control. In Parkinson's disease, the pathological STN neuronal activity leads to motor, cognitive, and emotional inhibition. Deafferentation of the STN by DBS can reverse such behavioural inhibition. The release of this brake allows both motor and non-motor improvement, but can also be associated with excessive motor, cognitive, and emotional behavioural disinhibition. Conversely, the notable reduction in anti-parkinsonian drug dose allowed by motor improvement can unveil mesolimbic hypodopaminergic behaviours such as apathy, anxiety, or depression. Fine-tuning of stimulation parameters with dopaminergic drugs is necessary to prevent or improve pathological behaviours. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",The Lancet Neurology,Mar-14

Second, an important distinction between abuse potential and addiction potential is drawn, with comments on how preclinical models can inform on each.Expert opinion: While the currently adopted preclinical models possess strong predictive validity, there are areas for future refinement and research. These areas include a more refined use of self-Administration models to assess relative reinforcement; and the need for open innovation in pursuing improvements. There is also the need for careful scientifically driven application of models rather than a standardization of methodologies, and the need to explore the opportunities that may exist for enhancing the value of physical dependence and withdrawal studies by focusing on withdrawal-induced drug seeking, rather than broad symptomology.Copyright © Informa UK, Ltd.",Expert Opinion on Drug Discovery,01-Nov-14

In this article, we attempt to review the pathophysiology and the clinical approach of lithium tremor. Method(s): We searched the Pubmed and Cochrane Library for relevant articles up to the year 2012. Sixty-four articles including 10 review papers, 3 clinical trials, and 12 case reports were reviewed. Result(s): Lithium tremor is classified as a postural tremor and subcategorized as an exaggerated physiologic tremor. Differential diagnosis includes metabolic abnormalities, benign essential tremor, Parkinson's disease, and lithium toxicity. Various methods of evaluating lithium tremor and treatment options are discussed. Conclusion(s): When lithium tremor has developed, thorough history taking, physical examination, and blood examination including serum lithium level are needed. Pharmacotherapy is indicated only in patients with disabling tremor. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.",Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica,Jan-14

treatment outcome","Deep brain stimulation, a technique whereby electrodes are implanted into specific brain regions to modulate their activity, has been mainly used to treat movement disorders. More recently this technique has been proposed for the treatment of drug addiction, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and dementia. The nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and hippocampus, central nuclei within the limbic system, have been studied as potential targets for neuromodulation for the treatment of drug addiction, PTSD, and dementia, respectively. As the scope of neuromodulation grows to include disorders of mood and thought, new ethical and philosophic challenges that require multidisciplinary discussion and cooperation are emerging. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",Neurosurgery Clinics of North America,Jan-14

stress","Intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) is a behavioral procedure in which operant responding is maintained by pulses of electrical brain stimulation. In research to study abuse-related drug effects, ICSS relies on electrode placements that target the medial forebrain bundle at the level of the lateral hypothalamus, and experimental sessions manipulate frequency or amplitude of stimulation to engender a wide range of baseline response rates or response probabilities. Under these conditions, drug-induced increases in low rates/probabilities of responding maintained by low frequencies/amplitudes of stimulation are interpreted as an abuse-related effect. Conversely, drug-induced decreases in high rates/probabilities of responding maintained by high frequencies/amplitudes of stimulation can be interpreted as an abuse-limiting effect. Overall abuse potential can be inferred from the relative expression of abuse-related and abuse-limiting effects. The sensitivity and selectivity of ICSS to detect abuse potential of many classes of abused drugs is similar to the sensitivity and selectivity of drug self-administration procedures. Moreover, similar to progressive-ratio drug selfadministration procedures, ICSS data can be used to rank the relative abuse potential of different drugs. Strengths of ICSS in comparison with drug selfadministration include 1) potential for simultaneous evaluation of both abuse-related and abuse-limiting effects, 2) flexibility for use with various routes of drug administration or drug vehicles, 3) utility for studies in drug-naive subjects as well as in subjects with controlled levels of prior drug exposure, and 4) utility for studies of drug time course. Taken together, these considerations suggest that ICSS can make significant contributions to the practice of abuse potential testing. © 2014 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.",Pharmacological Reviews,Jul-14

Result(s): The NMS of PD are becoming increasingly recognized as having a critical role in the impact of this neurodegenerative movement disorder. This has led to significant investigative efforts to identify new or better NMS therapies. The preponderance of PD patients will be diagnosed with 1 or multiple NMS during the course of their disease, with many of these symptoms occurring months or even years prior to receiving the PD diagnosis. Despite the high prevalence and impact on disease burden, NMS often go undetected due to a lack of reporting by patients or insufficient interrogation by physicians. Further complicating NMS management is that only a few therapies have the level of evidence needed to support their use in the treatment of NMS. Conclusion(s): The practitioner needs to be aware of NMS and conduct thorough patient questioning in order to recognize, diagnose, and address NMS in PD patients.",Journal of Clinical Outcomes Management,Feb-14

Method(s): Forty research participants, who all reported heavy drinking and daily smoking, were recruited (15 women; 70% Caucasian; mean age. = 31.2 years) for a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) session involving a cigarette video-cues task and an alcohol taste-cues task. Mean precuneus activation from both tasks during cue presentation was subjected to bivariate correlation analyses with indices of dependence severity and subjective craving. Result(s): Precuneus activation in the contrast of Cigarette Cues vs. Control Cues was positively correlated with scores on the Fagerstrom Test of Nicotine Dependence (r= 0.389, p= 0.016), and activation in the Alcohol Cues vs. Control Cues contrast was positively correlated with Alcohol Dependence Scale scores (r= 0.338, p= 0.038). No correlations with subjective craving were observed (ps. >. 0.05). Conclusion(s): These findings indicate that the precuneus is involved in cue reactivity for both cigarettes and alcohol, and that this involvement is moderated by severity of drug dependence. The precuneus may be a cortical locus for neuroplastic changes related to drug dependence. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Drug and Alcohol Dependence,01-Aug-14

Error processing is a central aspect of inhibitory control that determines adaptive adjustment of performance; yet it is a largely overlooked aspect of disinhibition as it relates to risk for SUD. We investigated whether differences in brain activation during both successful and failed inhibition predicts early problem substance use. Method(s): Forty-five 9-12 year olds underwent a functional MRI scan during a go/no-go task. They were then followed over approximately 4 years, completing assessments of substance use. Externalizing behavior was measured at ages 3-8, 9-12 and 11-13. Participants with drug use or problem alcohol use by ages 13-16 (n= 13; problem-user group) were individually matched by gender, age, and family history of alcoholism with non-substance-using children (n= 13; non-user group). The remaining 19 participants provided an independent sample from which to generate unbiased regions-of-interest for hypothesis testing in the problem-user and non-user groups. Result(s): No differences were observed between groups in activation during correct inhibition compared with baseline. A significant difference arose in left middle frontal gyrus (LMFG) activation during failed inhibition compared with correct inhibition, with the problem-user group demonstrating blunted activation. The problem-user group also had more externalizing problems at ages 11-13. Logistic regression found that activation of LMFG significantly predicted group membership over and above externalizing problems. Conclusion(s): Blunted LMFG activation during performance errors may underlie problems adapting behavior appropriately, leading to undercontrolled behavior, early problem substance use and increased risk for SUD. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Drug and Alcohol Dependence,01-Aug-14

This study aimed to understand the neurophysiological effects before and after acute MPH administration in active MA-dependent and control subjects. Fifteen MA-dependent and 18 control subjects aged 18-46 years were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging before and after either a single oral dose of MPH (18 mg) or placebo while performing a color-word Stroop task. Baseline accuracy was lower (p = 0.026) and response time (RT) was longer (p < 0.0001) for the incongruent compared to congruent condition, demonstrating the task probed cognitive control. Increased activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and parietal cortex during the incongruent and Stroop effect conditions, respectively was observed in MA-dependent compared to control subjects (p < 0.05), suggesting the need to recruit neural resources within these regions for conflict resolution. Post- compared to pre-MPH treatment, increased RT and DLPFC activation for the Stroop effect were observed in MA-dependent subjects (p < 0.05). In comparison to MPH-treated controls and placebo-treated MA-dependent subjects, MPH-treated MA-dependent subjects showed decreased activation of parietal and occipital regions during the incongruent and Stroop effect conditions (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that in MA-dependent subjects, MPH facilitated increased recruitment of the DLPFC for Stroop conflict resolution, and a decreased need for recruitment of neural resources in parietal and occipital regions compared to the other groups, while maintaining a comparable level of task performance to that achieved pre-drug administration. Due to the small sample size, the results from this study are preliminary; however, they inform us about the effects of MPH on the neural correlates of cognitive control in active MA-dependent subjects. © 2014 Jan, Lin, McLaren, Kirk, Kydd and Russell.",Frontiers in Psychiatry,2014

Bath salts may consist of one compound (MDPV) or combinations of MDPV and one or more other synthetic cathinones, which may also appear alone without MDPV. We briefly review recent in vitro studies of bath salts components alone or in combination, focusing on pharmacological and biophysical studies. Finally we summarize new data from in vivo procedures that characterize the abuse-related neurochemical and behavioral effects of synthetic cathinones in rats. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Another purpose is to discuss the neurobiological mechanisms of DBS and their implications for the understanding of OCD neurobiology and its link to OCD psychopathology. In particular, we will focus on DBS of the nucleus accumbens because of the involvement of this area in the reward system, which seems to be impaired in OCD patients. Finally, we will provide a new psychopathological conceptualization of OCD. Method(s): Extensive review of the DBS literature for OCD patients was performed on PubMed. Result(s): According to many neuroimaging studies, the neural circuit that seems to be most involved in OCD is the cortico-striatum-thalamus-cortical circuit (CSTC). Therefore, to date, five different components of this circuit have been tested as targets in DBS of OCD and show different efficacy: anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC), nucleus accumbens (Nacc), ventral capsule/ventral striatum (VC/VS), subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the inferior thalamic peduncle (ITP). Conclusion(s): DBS is a promising tool in the treatment of refractory OCD patients. The existing data show that the nucleus accumbens and the anterior limb of the internal capsule are the most promising targets for this treatment. Furthermore, DBS has shown new and interesting perspectives in the discovery of the neurobiological underpinnings of OCD. These new insights can provide a new psychopathological conceptualization of OCD, reconsidering this disorder as a primary anxiety disorder, rapidly moving as a behavioural addiction. However, further studies are needed to better clarify the long-term efficacy and safety of the procedure, and to better characterize the ideal patients that might have a good response to DBS.",Journal of Psychopathology,Mar-14

*substance abuse","Background: Drug dependent individuals often make drug-taking decisions when they do not feel well. Yet, few studies have examined the influence of an aversive state on decision-making related neural processing. Method(s): We investigate brain activation to decision-making during an aversive interoceptive challenge in methamphetamine users using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Recently abstinent inpatients with methamphetamine use disorder (METH; n= 20) and healthy comparison subjects (CTL; n= 22) performed a two-choice prediction task at three fixed error rates (ER; 20%. = reward, 50%. = uncertainty, 80%. = punishment) while anticipating and experiencing episodes of inspiratory breathing load during fMRI. Result(s): METH exhibited higher trait anxiety in conjunction with lower anterior insula (AI) and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) activation than CTL across trials. METH also showed lower posterior insula (PI) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activation than CTL during breathing load independent of ER. For the crucial ER by interoception interaction, METH displayed lower ACC activation to punishment/loss than CTL during breathing load. Within METH, lower trait anxiety was linked to AI/IFG attenuation across trials. Conclusion(s): AI/IFG attenuations in METH are suggestive of an executive functioning deficit, particularly in users with low anxiety, reflecting reduced resources allocated to choice selection. In contrast, PI/ACC reductions in METH appear specific to impairments in registering and evaluating interoceptive experiences. Taken together, inadequate activation of brain areas that are important for regulating when one does not feel well may be the neural basis for poor decision-making by METH. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Drug and Alcohol Dependence,01-Sep-14

thalamus nucleus","Because of our limited knowledge of the functional role of the thalamostriatal system, this massive network is often ignored in models of the pathophysiology of brain disorders of basal ganglia origin, such as Parkinson's disease (PD). However, over the past decade, significant advances have led to a deeper understanding of the anatomical, electrophysiological, behavioral and pathological aspects of the thalamostriatal system. The cloning of the vesicular glutamate transporters 1 and 2 (vGluT1 and vGluT2) has provided powerful tools to differentiate thalamostriatal from corticostriatal glutamatergic terminals, allowing us to carry out comparative studies of the synaptology and plasticity of these two systems in normal and pathological conditions. Findings from these studies have led to the recognition of two thalamostriatal systems, based on their differential origin from the caudal intralaminar nuclear group, the center median/parafascicular (CM/Pf) complex, or other thalamic nuclei. The recent use of optogenetic methods supports this model of the organization of the thalamostriatal systems, showing differences in functionality and glutamate receptor localization at thalamostriatal synapses from Pf and other thalamic nuclei. At the functional level, evidence largely gathered from thalamic recordings in awake monkeys strongly suggests that the thalamostriatal system from the CM/Pf is involved in regulating alertness and switching behaviors. Importantly, there is evidence that the caudal intralaminar nuclei and their axonal projections to the striatum partly degenerate in PD and that CM/Pf deep brain stimulation (DBS) may be therapeutically useful in several movement disorders. © 2014 Smith, Galvan, Ellender, Doig, Villalba, Huerta-Ocampo, Wichman and Bolam.",Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience,30-Jan-14

withdrawal syndrome","Almost 10% of the world's population is affected by alcohol use disorders, and the treatment of alcohol dependence (AD) still remains a challenge. Patients with AD can differ in many traits. Three drugs (disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate) have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of AD, and in some European countries sodium oxybate is also approved for this purpose. Combined pharmacological therapy has not provided such convincing results. Considering the fact that the ideal and effective drug for all types of alcoholic patients does not exists, the future challenge will be to identify a personalized approach. Recent data has shown that this objective can be achieved by investigating the genetic variability of the patient. Moreover, the use of replacement molecules can probably be considered an advantageous therapeutic opportunity (i.e. sodium oxybate). In addition, reduction of alcohol consumption is increasingly accepted as a viable treatment goal, and the use of nalmefene as-needed (a pharmacological approach similar to naltrexone, but, possibly, with lower hepatotoxicity) may help in the treatment of AD. Thus, it is important to stress that a pharmacological approach to treat AD should be preceded by the definition of patient characteristics; this may help in the choice of the most appropriate drug and it can be done more easily when more pharmacological options approved for the treatment of AD are also available. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP.",European Neuropsychopharmacology,Feb-14

Some forms of obesity may arise from eating disorders and recent data suggest that rTMS treatment could have beneficial effects in eating disorders. Purpose(s): The purpose of this comprehensive review is to hypothesize that rTMS may play a role in obesity. Material(s) and Method(s): Articles were selected based on a search on medline using the terms ""rTMS"", ""food craving"", ""eating disorders"", ""addiction"", and ""obesity"". They were published between 1995 and 2013. Result(s): Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation has been evaluated in the treatment of bulimia nervosa. It appears that it exerts its effect via the reduction of the level of craving for food. Obesity is being recognized as one of the endpoints of food addiction and craving. Besides, rTMS and transcranial direct current stimulation are brain stimulation techniques being used in the treatment of psychoactive substance addiction. Conclusion(s): Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, through the reduction of food craving may be a potential treatment for a subset of individuals suffering from obesity. Further studies with a higher number of subjects are still needed to confirm the effects of rTMS on obesity. © 2013 Springer International Publishing.",Eating and Weight Disorders,Sep-14

review","The ability to probe defined neural circuits with both the spatial and temporal resolution imparted by optogenetics has transformed the field of neuroscience. Although much attention has been paid to the advantages of manipulating neural activity at millisecond timescales in order to elicit time-locked neural responses, little consideration has been given to the manipulation of circuit activity at physiologically relevant times of day, across multiple days. Nearly all biological events are governed by the circadian clock and exhibit 24 h rhythms in activity. Indeed, neural circuit activity itself exhibits a daily rhythm with distinct temporal peaks in activity occurring at specific times of the day. Therefore, experimentally probing circuit function within and across physiologically relevant time windows (minutes to hours) in behaving animals is fundamental to understanding the function of any one particular circuit within the intact brain. Furthermore, understanding how circuit function changes with repeated manipulation is important for modeling the circuit-wide disruptions that occur with chronic disease states. Here, we review recent advances in optogenetic technology that allow for chronic, temporally specific, control of circuit activity and provide examples of chronic optogenetic paradigms that have been utilized in the search for the neural circuit basis of behaviors relevant to human neuropsychiatric disease. © 2014 Sidor and McClung.",Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience,14-Feb-14

upregulation","The transcription factor DELTAFosB is upregulated in numerous brain regions following repeated drug exposure. This induction is likely to, at least in part, be responsible for the mechanisms underlying addiction, a disorder in which the regulation of gene expression is thought to be essential. In this review, we describe and discuss the proposed role of DELTAFosB as well as the implications of recent findings. The expression of DELTAFosB displays variability dependent on the administered substance, showing region-specificity for different drug stimuli. This transcription factor is understood to act via interaction with Jun family proteins and the formation of activator protein-1 (AP-1) complexes. Once AP-1 complexes are formed, a multitude of molecular pathways are initiated, causing genetic, molecular and structural alterations. Many of these molecular changes identified are now directly linked to the physiological and behavioral changes observed following chronic drug exposure. In addition, DELTAFosB induction is being considered as a biomarker for the evaluation of potential therapeutic interventions for addiction.Copyright © 2014 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

Pathological alterations of plasticity are increasingly explored as pathophysiological foundation of diverse neurological and psychiatric diseases. Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques (NIBS), such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), are able to induce and modulate neuroplasticity in humans. Therefore, they have potential to alter pathological plasticity on the one hand, and foster physiological plasticity on the other, in neuropsychiatric diseases to reduce symptoms, and enhance rehabilitation. tDCS is an emerging NIBS tool, which induces glutamatergic plasticity via application of relatively weak currents through the scalp in humans. In the last years its efficacy to treat neuropsychiatric diseases has been explored increasingly. In this review, we will give an overview of pathological alterations of plasticity in neuropsychiatric diseases, gather clinical studies involving tDCS to ameliorate symptoms, and discuss future directions of application, with an emphasis on optimizing stimulation effects. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",NeuroImage,15-Jan-14

A small subset of STN DBS patients experience troublesome dyskinesia despite optimal programming and medication adjustments. This group of patients has been referred to by some practitioners as brittle STN DBS-induced dyskinesia, drawing on comparisons with brittle diabetics experiencing severe blood sugar regulation issues and on a single description by McLellan in 1982. We sought to describe, and also to investigate how often the ""brittle"" phenomenon occurs in a relatively large DBS practice. Method(s): An Institutional Review Board-approved patient database was reviewed, and all STN and globus pallidus internus (GPi) DBS patients who had surgery at the University of Florida from July 2002 to July 2012 were extracted for analysis. Result(s): There were 179 total STN DBS patients and, of those, four STN DBS (2.2%) cases were identified as having dyskinesia that could not be managed without the induction of an ""off state,"" or by the precipitation of a severe dyskinesia despite vigorous stimulation and medication adjustments. Of 75 GPi DBS cases reviewed, none (0%) was identified as having brittle dyskinesia. One STN DBS patient was successfully rescued by bilateral GPi DBS. Discussion(s): Understanding the potential risk factors for postoperative troublesome and brittle dyskinesia may have an impact on the initial surgical target selection (STN vs. GPI) in DBS therapy. Rescue GPi DBS therapy may be a viable treatment option, though more cases will be required to verify this observ © 2014 Lee et al.",Tremor and Other Hyperkinetic Movements,2014

The relationship between these approaches is unknown, therapeutic mechanisms remain unclear, and the ideal stimulation site for a given technique is often ambiguous, limiting optimization of the stimulation and its application in further disorders. In this article, we identify diseases treated with both types of stimulation, list the stimulation sites thought to be most effective in each disease, and test the hypothesis that these sites are different nodes within the same brain network as defined by resting-state functional-connectivity MRI. Sites where DBS was effective were functionally connected to sites where noninvasive brain stimulation was effective across diseases including depression, Parkinson's disease, obsessive-compulsive disorder, essential tremor, addiction, pain, minimally conscious states, and Alzheimer's disease. A lack of functional connectivity identified sites where stimulation was ineffective, and the sign of the correlation related to whether excitatory or inhibitory noninvasive stimulation was found clinically effective. These results suggest that resting-state functional connectivity may be useful for translating therapy between stimulation modalities, optimizing treatment, and identifying new stimulation targets. More broadly, this work supports a network perspective toward understanding and treating neuropsychiatric disease, highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeted brain network modulation.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,14-Oct-14

The application of deep brain stimulation in the treatment of certain psychiatric disorders has been intensively investigated taking into account the current knowledge of neurobiological basis of mood regulation, cognition, and behaviour. This paper has been aimed at presenting the available data on experience in the application of deep brain stimulation in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. It gives an overview of scientific and professional literature, bearing in mind all the contemporary approaches in the treatment of certain psychiatric disorders. Research results available so far in the treatment of treatment-resistant depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, addiction and Alzheimer's dementia, are affirmative concerning the efficacy of the method and low risk of adverse effects. Deep brain stimulation, as a relatively new neurosurgical method in the treatment of psychiatric disorders, is being intensively developed, and it is certainly going to be one of the treatments of choice, primarily of treatment-resistant disorders.",Medicinski pregled,01-Jan-14

Presently, it is used for neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease, but indications are expanding to psychiatric disorders such as depression, addiction and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Theoretically, it may be possible to use DBS for the enhancement of various mental functions. This article discusses a case of an OCD patient who felt very happy with the DBS treatment, even though her symptoms were not reduced. First, it is explored if the argument that 'doctors are not in the business of trading happiness', as used by her psychiatrist to justify his discontinuation of the DBS treatment, holds. The relationship between enhancement and the goals of medicine is discussed and it is concluded that even though the goals of medicine do not set strict limits and may even include certain types of enhancement, there are some good reasons for limiting the kind of things doctors are required or allowed to do. Next, the case is discussed from the perspective of beneficence and autonomy. It is argued that making people feel good is not the same as enhancing their well-being and that it is unlikely - though not absolutely impossible - that the well-being of the happy OCD patient is really improved. Finally, some concerns regarding the autonomy of a request made under the influence of DBS treatment are considered. © 2011 The Author(s).",Neuroethics,Dec-13

treatment planning","Despite novel medications and other therapeutic strategies, addiction to psychotropic substances remains one of the most serious public health problems worldwide. In this review, beginning with an introduction of deep brain stimulation (DBS), we highlight the importance of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in the context of the reward circuitry and addictive behavior. We will provide a short historic overview of other neurosurgical approaches to treat addiction and describe the experimental and preclinical data on DBS in addiction. Finally, we call attention to key ethical issues related to using DBS to treat addiction that are important for future research and the design of clinical trials. © 2012 New York Academy of Sciences.",,Apr-13

subthalamus","Background: Levodopa therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with non-motor complications resulting from sensitisation of the ventral striatum system. Recent studies showed an improvement in non-motor complications in PD patients with subthalamic stimulation. We hypothesised that ventral striatum desensitisation might contribute to this improvement. Method(s): Psychostimulant effects of levodopa were prospectively assessed in 36 PD patients with an acute levodopa challenge, before and 1 year after chronic subthalamic stimulation, using the Addiction Research Centre Inventory euphoria subscale. Postoperative evaluation was performed with the same dose of levodopa used in the preoperative assessment and after switching off stimulation. Preoperative and postoperative non-motor fluctuations in everyday life were investigated with the Ardouin Scale. Furthermore, in order to artificially reproduce non-motor fluctuations, a levodopa challenge keeping subthalamic stimulation on was performed to assess depression, anxiety and motivation before and after surgery under the different medication conditions. Result(s): After 1 year of chronic subthalamic stimulation with 60.3% reduction in dopaminergic medication, the acute psychostimulant effects of levodopa were significantly reduced compared with preoperatively, as measured by the euphoria subscale (7.22+/-4.75 vs 4.75 +/-5.68; p=0.0110). On chronic subthalamic stimulation and with markedly reduced dopaminergic medication, non-motor fluctuations were significantly improved. While off medication/on stimulation scores of depression and anxiety were improved, in the on medication/on stimulation condition the motivation score worsened. Conclusion(s): Acute psychostimulant effects of levodopa (off stimulation) were significantly reduced 1 year after surgery. These findings are likely due to desensitisation of the ventral striatum, allowed by the reduction of dopaminergic treatment, and the replacement of pulsatile treatment with continuous subthalamic stimulation.","Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry",Jan-13

Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale","Background: Behavioural disorders associated with compulsive use of dopaminergic drugs for Parkinson's disease (PD) such as dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS) and impulse control disorders (ICDs) may have devastating consequences and are challenging to manage. Whether or not such patients should undergo subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) is controversial. A few case reports and small series have reported contrasting effects of STN DBS on dopamine misuse and ICDs, while a recent prospective study found clear beneficial effects of STN DBS on these disorders. Method(s): We conducted an observational study on 110 consecutive parkinsonian patients scheduled for STN DBS surgery. Patients were assessed preoperatively through extensive behavioural and psychiatric evaluations and divided into two groups: with or without compulsive dopaminergic medication use. Evaluations were repeated 1 year after surgery in both groups. Result(s): Before surgery 18 patients (16.3%) were compulsive dopamine users of whom 12 (10.9%) fulfilled all criteria for DDS. 90% of these patients also had at least one ICD compared to 20% in the group without compulsive dopamine use. One year after surgery, one patient had persistent compulsive dopamine use, while no new occurrences were reported in the group without the condition before surgery. STN DBS did not provoke any major psychiatric complications and ICDs were reduced in all patients. Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that STN DBS may reduce compulsive use of dopaminergic medication and its behavioural consequences. Whether this improvement is the result of STN DBS or the consequence of better treatment management remains to be established.","Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry",2013

Here we review the rationale of DBS in addiction and the selection of possible targets. We then consider evidence from animal models as well as human case studies. We conclude that DBS in particular of the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) represents a promising treatment option in addiction which deserves further investigation.Copyright © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.",,08-Jun-12

virtual reality exposure therapy","Exposure therapy is a widely used and effective form of treatment in anxiety disorders and addictions but evidence for its usefulness in eating disorders (ED) is inconsistent. This paper systematically reviews the literature on the use of exposure therapy in ED, the theory underpinning its use, and the deficits in current knowledge. Databases were searched to 2012. In addition, potential improvements in the use of exposure techniques in ED are considered by drawing upon theory and research involving neuropharmacology, basic and clinical neuroscience, contemporary behavioural and neurobiological research, and technologies such as virtual reality (VR). © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews,Feb-13

reward","Background: The consequences of chronic alcohol dependence cause important health and economic burdens worldwide. Relapse rates after standard treatment (medication and psychotherapy) are high. There is evidence from in vivo investigations and from studies in patients that the brain's reward system is critically involved in the development and maintenance of addictive behavior, suggesting that modification of this system could significantly improve the prognosis of addictive patients. Motivated by an accidental observation, we used the nucleus accumbens (NAc), which has a central position in the dopaminergic reward system for deep brain stimulation (DBS) of alcohol addiction. Method(s): We report our first experiences with NAc DBS for alcohol dependence and review the literature addressing the mechanisms leading to addiction. Result(s): Five patients were treated off-label with bilateral NAc DBS for severe alcohol addiction (average follow-up 38 months). All patients experienced significant and ongoing improvement of craving. Two patients remained completely abstinent for more than 4 years. NAc stimulation was tolerated without permanent side effects. Simultaneous recording of local field potentials from the target area and surface electroencephalography while patients performed neuropsychological tasks gave a hint on the pivotal role of the NAc in processing alcohol-related cues. Conclusion(s): To our knowledge, the data presented here reflect the first attempt to treat alcohol-addicted patients with NAc DBS. Electrical NAc stimulation probably counterbalances the effect of drug-related stimuli triggering involuntarily drug-seeking behavior. Meanwhile, two prospective clinical studies using randomized, double-blind, and crossover stimulation protocols for DBS are underway to corroborate these preliminary results. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

*surgical technique","Advances in deep brain stimulation (DBS) in relation to neuroimaging techniques and with intraoperative electrophysiological microrecordings and stimulations have replaced ablative procedures for medication-refractory movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, dystonia, and essential tremor. DBS is an effective surgical treatment for these conditions and is now being extended to psychiatric diseases such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, and addiction. Despite the proven clinical improvement by DBS, its precise mechanism of action remains unclear. Clinical improvement depends on the selection of the appropriate patients and the precise implantation of the stimulation electrodes, which is based on careful stereotactic targeting and extensive electrophysiological monitoring of the target area. Further studies are being performed to better understand the mechanism of action and identify new anatomical targets and clinical applications of DBS. We briefly introduce the surgical procedure and current clinical applications of DBS in this review. © Korean Medical Association.",Journal of the Korean Medical Association,Aug-13

Recent Findings: Progress in tracking of seizures, identifying and addressing medication nonadherence, treatment with novel devices, and clinical decision support algorithms will provide additional management options in the future. Summary: The management of pediatric seizures and epilepsies presents multiple challenges to the clinician because of nonepileptic imitators, evolving classification approaches, clinical presentations, limited clinical trial data for medications, and the toxicities of therapies. While certain pediatric seizures and epilepsy syndromes respond best to certain medications, early identification of pharmacologically resistant patients who may be candidates for epilepsy surgery is important. Alternative treatment options may include ketogenic diet or vagus nerve stimulation. © 2013, American Academy of Neurology.",CONTINUUM Lifelong Learning in Neurology,Jun-13

ventromedial prefrontal cortex","Adaptive behaviors increase the likelihood of survival and reproduction and improve the quality of life. However, it is often difficult to identify optimal behaviors in real life due to the complexity of the decision maker@s environment and social dynamics. As a result, although many different brain areas and circuits are involved in decision making, evolutionary and learning solutions adopted by individual decision makers sometimes produce suboptimal outcomes. Although these problems are exacerbated in numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders, their underlying neurobiological causes remain incompletely understood. In this review, theoretical frameworks in economics and machine learning and their applications in recent behavioral and neurobiological studies are summarized. Examples of such applications in clinical domains are also discussed for substance abuse, Parkinson@s disease, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, mood disorders, and autism. Findings from these studies have begun to lay the foundations necessary to improve diagnostics and treatment for various neurological and psychiatric disorders",Neuron,24-Apr-13

The ""neurogenesis hypothesis of depression"" posits that changes in the rate of neurogenesis are the underlying mechanism in the pathology and treatment of major depression. Stress, neuroinflammation, dysfunctional insulin regulation, oxidative stress, and alterations in neurotrophic factors possibly contribute to the development of depression. The influence of antidepressant therapies, namely pharmacotherapy and neuroprotectants, on cellular plasticity are summarized. A dysfunction of complex neuronal networks as a consequence of neural degeneration in neuropsychiatric diseases has led to the application of deep brain stimulation. We discuss the way depression seen in the light of the neurogenesis hypothesis can be used as a model diseasefor cerebral aging. A common pathological mechanism in depression and cerebral aging-a dysfunction of neuroprotection and neurogenesis- is discussed. This has implications for new treatment methods. © 2013 LLS SAS.",Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience,Mar-13

One operational definition of impulsive behavior is the stop-signal task (SST) which measures the time needed to stop a ballistic hand movement. Objective(s): Employ functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study right frontal responses to stop signals in heavy drinking subjects with and without FHA, and as a function of alcohol exposure. Method(s): Twenty-two family history-positive (FHP; age = 22.7 years, SD = 1.9) and 18 family history-negative (FHN; age = 23.7, SD = 1.8) subjects performed the SST in fMRI in two randomized visits: once during intravenous infusion of alcohol, clamped at a steady-state breath alcohol (BrAC) concentration of 60 mg/dL, and once during infusion of placebo saline. An independent reference group (n = 13, age = 23.7, SD = 1.8) was used to identify a priori right prefrontal regions activated by successful inhibition (Inh) trials, relative to ""Go"" trials that carried no need for inhibition [Inh > Go]. Result(s): FHA interacted with alcohol exposure in right prefrontal cortex, where alcohol reduced [Inh > Go] activation in FHN subjects but not in FHP subjects. Within this right frontal cortical region, stop-signal reaction time also correlated negatively with [Inh > Go] activation, suggesting that the [Inh > Go] activity was related to inhibitory behavior. Conclusion(s): The results are consistent with the low level of response theory (Schuckit, J Stud Alcohol 55:149-158, 1980; Quinn and Fromme, Alcohol Clin Exp Res 35:1759-1770, 2011), with FHP being less sensitive to alcohol's effects. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Psychopharmacology,Jul-13

Improved understanding of brain circuitries and their involvement in various neurological and psychiatric illnesses, coupled with the safety of DBS and its exquisite role as a tool for ethical study of the human brain, have unlocked new opportunities for this technology, both for future therapies and in research. Serendipitous discoveries and advances in structural and functional imaging are providing abundant ""new"" brain targets for an ever-increasing number of pathologies, leading to investigations of DBS in diverse neurological, psychiatric, behavioral, and cognitive conditions. Trials and ""proof of concept"" studies of DBS are underway in pain, epilepsy, tinnitus, OCD, depression, and Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, as well as in eating disorders, addiction, cognitive decline, consciousness, and autonomic states. In parallel, ongoing technological development will provide pulse generators with longer battery longevity, segmental electrode designs allowing a current steering, and the possibility to deliver ""on-demand"" stimulation based on closed-loop concepts. The future of brain stimulation is certainly promising, especially for movement disorders-that will remain the main indication for DBS for the foreseeable future-and probably for some psychiatric disorders. However, brain stimulation as a technique may be at risk of gliding down a slippery slope: Some reports indicate a disturbing trend with suggestions that future DBS may be proposed for enhancement of memory in healthy people, or as a tool for ""treatment"" of ""antisocial behavior"" and for improving ""morality"". © 2013 Movement Disorder Society.",Movement Disorders,Nov-13

This was due to the insufficient knowledge of both neural networks of the brain and the pathophysiology of psychiatric diseases. The aggressive surgical treatment modalities with high mortality and morbidity rates, the controversial ethical concerns, and the introduction of antipsychotic drugs were also among those obstacles. With the recent advancements in the field of neuroscience more accurate knowledge was gained in this field offering new ideas for the management of these diseases. Also, the recent technological developments aided the surgeons to define more sophisticated and minimally invasive techniques during the surgical procedures. Maybe the most important factor in the rerising of psychosurgery is the assemblage of the experts, clinicians, and researchers in various fields of neurosciences implementing a multidisciplinary approach. In this article, the authors aim to review the latest concepts of the pathophysiology and the recent advancements of the surgical treatment of psychiatric diseases from a neurosurgical point of view. © 2013 Georg Thieme Verlag KG.","Journal of Neurological Surgery, Part A: Central European Neurosurgery",Jan-13

treatment outcome","Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established, in selected cases therapeutically effective, non-lesional treatment method delivering current rectangular pulses into dysfunctional brain structures via chronically implanted stimulation electrodes. DBS is a recognized method applied in movement disorders and is increasingly evaluated as a possible therapeutic option for psychiatric diseases such as refractory obsessive-compulsive disorders, Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, major depression, and substance-related addiction. Latest research indicates that DBS may be a method for improving cognitive functions in Alzheimer's dementia (AD). Translational data in healthy and AD animals appear to support this notion. Nevertheless, many aspects remain unclear, particularly with regard to the optimal target structure. The objective of this review is to present a systematic overview regarding published research on DBS and cognitive functioning in animal and human studies as well as to provide a systematic overview of the feasibility and efficacy of the treatment. We describe three studies investigating the effects of DBS in patients with dementia, using either the fornix or the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) as a target. In total, we identified 25 animal studies with 10 brain structures being targeted: fornix, NBM, anterior caudate nucleus, dorsal striatum, anterior thalamic nucleus, midline thalamic nuclei, central thalamus, lateral hypothalamus, hippocampus (entorhinal cortex, perforant path), and amygdala. Considering the wide and diverse spectrum of targets, we add to this review a supposition about possible underlying mechanisms of operation and recommendations for further research. © 2013 Hardenacke, Shubina, Buhrle, Zapf, Lenartz, Klosterkotter, Visser-Vandewalle and Kuhn.",Frontiers in Psychiatry,2013

withdrawal syndrome / therapy","According to the triadic neurocognitive model of addiction to drugs (e.g., cocaine) and non-drugs (e.g., gambling), weakened ""willpower"" associated with these behaviors is the product of an abnormal functioning in one or more of three key neural and cognitive systems: (1) an amygdala-striatum dependent system mediating automatic, habitual, and salient behaviors; (2) a prefrontal cortex dependent system important for self-regulation and forecasting the future consequences of a behavior; and (3) an insula dependent system for the reception of interoceptive signals and their translation into feeling states (such as urge and craving), which in turn plays a strong influential role in decision-making and impulse control processes related to uncertainty, risk, and reward. The described three-systems account for poor decision-making (i.e., prioritizing short-term consequences of a decisional option) and stimulus-driven actions, thus leading to a more elevated risk for relapse. Finally, this article elaborates on the need for ""personalized"" clinical model-based interventions targeting interactions between implicit processes, interoceptive signaling, and supervisory function aimed at helping individuals become less governed by immediate situations and automatic pre-potent responses, and more influenced by systems involved in the pursuit of future valued goals. © 2013 Noel, Brevers and Bechara.",Frontiers in Psychiatry,2013

withdrawal syndrome","Prescription opioid misuse and addiction among chronic pain patients are emerging public health concerns of considerable significance. Estimates suggest that more than 10% of chronic pain patients misuse opioid analgesics, and the number of fatalities related to nonmedical or inappropriate use of prescription opioids is climbing. Because the prevalence and adverse consequences of this threat are increasing, there is a pressing need for research that identifies the biobehavioral risk chain linking chronic pain, opioid analgesia, and addictive behaviors. To that end, the current manuscript draws upon current neuropsychopharmacologic research to provide a conceptual framework of the downward spiral leading to prescription opioid misuse and addiction among chronic pain patients receiving opioid analgesic pharmacotherapy. Addictive use of opioids is described as the outcome of a cycle initiated by chronic pain and negative affect and reinforced by opioidergic-dopamingeric interactions, leading to attentional hypervigilance for pain and drug cues, dysfunctional connectivity between self-referential and cognitive control networks in the brain, and allostatic dysregulation of stress and reward circuitry. Implications for clinical practice are discussed; multimodal, mindfulness-oriented treatment is introduced as a potentially effective approach to disrupting the downward spiral and facilitating recovery from chronic pain and opioid addiction. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews,Dec-13

withdrawal syndrome","Drug addiction can be defined by a three-stage cycle - binge/intoxication, withdrawal/negative affect, and preoccupation/anticipation - that involves allostatic changes in the brain reward and stress systems. Two primary sources of reinforcement, positive and negative reinforcement, have been hypothesized to play a role in this allostatic process. The negative emotional state that drives negative reinforcement is hypothesized to derive from dysregulation of key neurochemical elements involved in the brain reward and stress systems. Specific neurochemical elements in these structures include not only decreases in reward system function (within-system opponent processes) but also recruitment of the brain stress systems mediated by corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and dynorphin-kappa opioid systems in the ventral striatum, extended amygdala, and frontal cortex (both between-system opponent processes). CRF antagonists block anxiety-like responses associated with withdrawal, block increases in reward thresholds produced by withdrawal from drugs of abuse, and block compulsive-like drug taking during extended access. Excessive drug taking also engages the activation of CRF in the medial prefrontal cortex, paralleled by deficits in executive function that may facilitate the transition to compulsive-like responding. Neuropeptide Y, a powerful anti-stress neurotransmitter, has a profile of action on compulsive-like responding for ethanol similar to a CRF1 antagonist. Blockade of the ? opioid system can also block dysphoric-like effects associated with withdrawal from drugs of abuse and block the development of compulsive-like responding during extended access to drugs of abuse, suggesting another powerful brain stress system that contributes to compulsive drug seeking. The loss of reward function and recruitment of brain systems provide a powerful neurochemical basis that drives the compulsivity of addiction. © 2013 Koob.",Frontiers in Psychiatry,2013

wakefulness","Optogenetics is a powerful tool for investigating causal links between neural circuits and behavior. In recent years, optogenetic studies have expanded into the emotional realm, elucidating new facts about the circuits that underlie anxiety, depression, and reward. One caveat with investigating this realm is that emotional responses can be non-linear. Reward is pleasurable to a point, beyond which it can produce mania, an anxious, and unpleasant state. Consistent with this, stimulant drugs that increase dopaminergic function are reinforcing across a limited dose range, above which they are no longer reinforcing, presumably because of anxiogenic effects (Ettenberg and Geist, 1991, 1993; Yang et al., 1992; Deroche et al., 1997). Many published optogenetic studies have not examined potential non-linearities in the relationship between neural activity and the behavior being studied, nor identified where on such a curve their optogenetic manipulation is acting. In addition, the state a neural system achieves during optogenetic stimulation may not necessarily reside on a physiological curve at all, as optogenetics can drive firing parameters outside of physiological ranges (Figure 1). We believe that further consideration of this point may lead to more accurate insights into the relationships between neural activity, emotions, and behavior. © 2013 Kravitzand Bonci.",Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience,19-Nov-13

Using an fMRI paradigm, we investigated whether memory performance by alcoholics on a face-name association test previously observed to be problematic for alcoholics could be explained by desynchronous activity between nodes of these specific networks. While in the scanner, 18 alcoholics and 15 controls performed a face-name associative learning task with different levels of processing at encoding. This task was designed to activate the hippocampus, cerebellum, and frontal cortex. Alcoholics and controls were also scanned at rest. Twelve alcoholics and 12 controls were selected to be matched on face-name recognition performance. Task-related fMRI analysis indicated that alcoholics had preserved limbic activation but lower cerebellar activation (Crus II) than the controls in the face-name learning task. Crus II was, therefore, chosen as a seed for functional connectivity MRI analysis. At rest, the left hippocampus and left Crus II had positively synchronized activity in controls, while hippocampal and cerebellar activities were negatively synchronized in alcoholics. Task engagement resulted in hippocampal-cerebellar desynchronization in both groups. We speculate that atypical cerebello-hippocampal activity synchronization during rest in alcoholics was reset to the normal pattern of asynchrony by task engagement. Aberrations from the normal pattern of resting-state default mode synchrony could be interpreted as enabling preserved face-name associative memory in alcoholism. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",Brain Structure and Function,May-13

Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale","Because of its reversibility and adaptability, deep brain stimulation (DBS) has recently gained interest in psychiatric disorders, such as obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD) and depression. In OCD, DBS is now an alternative procedure to lesions of fascicles such as the anterior capsule, which links the orbitofrontal cortex, the cingulum, and the thalamus, and has been applied to new target such as the nucleus accumbens, with promising results. However, a recent interest has been developed toward the subthalamic nucleus (STN), a key structure of the basal ganglia that connects the motor, limbic, and associative systems. It is known from patients with Parkinson disease that STN-DBS can have significant effects on mood and cognition. Those transient effects are usually seen as ""side effects"" in Parkinson disease, but are clues to the underappreciated role that STN plays in the limbic circuitry, a role whose precise details are as yet unknown and under active investigation. We present the rationale supporting the use of nonmotor STN as a therapeutic target to treat OCD. In particular, we discuss the recent experience and preliminary results of our group after 6 months of nonmotor STN-DBS in patients with severe OCD. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale","Objective: Stimulation of the inferior thalamic peduncle (ITP) is emerging as a promising new therapeutic target in certain psychiatric disorders. The circuitry that includes the nonspecific thalamic system (NSTS), which projects via the ITP to the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), is involved in the physiopathology of major depression disorder (MDD) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). The safety and efficacy of chronic ITP stimulation in cases of MDD and OCD refractory to medical treatment is presented. Material(s) and Method(s): Six patients with OCD and one with MDD were implanted with tetrapolar deep brain stimulation electrodes in the ITP (x = 3.5 mm lateral to the ventricular wall, y = 5 mm behind the anterior commissure, and z = at the intercommissural plane, i.e., anterior commissure-posterior commissure [AC-PC] level). The effect of chronic stimulation at 130 Hz, 450 mus, and 5.0 V on OCD was evaluated before and 3, 6, and 12 months after initiation of electrical stimulation through the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and Global Assessment of Function scale. Result(s): Chronic ITP electrical stimulation in OCD patients decreased the mean Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale score to around 51% for the group at the 12-month follow-up, and increased the mean Global Assessment of Function scale score to 68% for a significant improvement (P = 0.026). Three of 6 patients returned to work. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score of the only patient with MDD treated to date went from 42 to 6. This condition of the patient, who had been incapacitated for 5 years prior to surgery, has not relapsed for 9 years. Three OCD patients with drug addiction continued to consume drugs in spite of their improvement in OCD. Conclusion(s): Deep brain stimulation in the ITP is safe and may be effective in the treatment of OCD. A multicenter evaluation of the safety and efficacy of ITP in OCD is currently in process. © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",World Neurosurgery,September-October 2013

Over time, the application of DBS has increasingly been considered as a therapeutic option for several neuropsychiatric disorders, including Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, obsessive compulsive disorder, major depression and addiction. Latest research suggests beneficial effects of DBS in Alzheimer dementia (AD). Because of the high prevalence and the considerable burden of the disease, we endeavored to discuss and reveal the challenges of DBS in AD. Method(s): Recent literature on the pathophysiology of AD, including translational data and human studies, has been studied to generate a fundamental hypothesis regarding the effects of electrical stimulation on cognition and to facilitate our ongoing pilot study regarding DBS of the nucleus basalis Meynert (NBM) in patients with AD. Result(s): It is hypothesized that DBS in the nucleus basalis Meynert could probably improve or at least stabilize memory and cognitive functioning in patients with AD by facilitating neural oscillations and by enhancing the synthesis of nerve growth factors. Conclusion(s): Considering the large number of patients suffering from AD, there is a great need for novel and effective treatment methods. Our research provides insights into the theoretical background of DBS in AD. Providing that our hypothesis will be validated by our ongoing pilot study, DBS could be an opportunity in the treatment of AD. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

With improved understanding of the dysfunctional circuitry mediating various psychiatric disorders, deep brain stimulation for refractory psychiatric diseases is being increasingly explored in human patients. These factors are likely to facilitate development of gene therapy for psychiatric diseases. Because delivery of gene therapy agents would require the same surgical techniques currently being employed for deep brain stimulation, neurosurgeons are likely to lead the development of this field, as has occurred in other areas of clinical gene therapy for neurologic disorders. We review the current state of gene therapy for psychiatric disorders and focus specifically on particular areas of promising research that may translate into human trials for depression, drug addiction, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and schizophrenia. Issues that are relatively unique to psychiatric gene therapy are also discussed. © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",World Neurosurgery,September-October 2013

Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale","Radiosurgery for psychiatric disorders has been performed for more than 50 years. The use of deep brain stimulation has recently been expanded to the investigational treatment of specific psychiatric disorders. A literature review of past studies incorporating radiosurgical stereotactic lesions for psychiatric disorders was performed to provide historic context and possible guidance for current and future attempts at treating psychiatric disorders, especially by gamma capsulotomy. The anatomic target localization, dose selection, and the outcome of the radiosurgical procedures were reviewed, and the evolutions of lesioning strategies were analyzed with particular emphasis on the dose selection. Large-scale prospective studies with strict inclusion and well-defined, objective outcome criteria are necessary for defining the role of radiosurgery for the treatment of psychiatric disorders. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

DBS is an adjustable and reversible neurosurgical intervention using implanted electrodes to deliver controlled electrical pulses to targeted areas of the brain. It holds great promise for therapy-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder. Several double-blind controlled and open trials have been conducted and the response rate is estimated around 54%. Open trials have shown encouraging results with DBS for therapy-refractory depression and case reports have shown potential effects of DBS on addiction. Another promising indication is Tourette syndrome, where potential efficacy of DBS is shown by several case series and a few controlled trials. Further research should focus on optimizing DBS with respect to target location and increasing the number of controlled double-blinded trials. In addition, new indications for DBS and new target options should be explored in preclinical research. © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",World Neurosurgery,September-October 2013

withdrawal syndrome / side effect","Pathological gambling (PG) and other Impulse Control Disorders (ICDs), such as hypersexuality, compulsive eating and buying, are often reported in Parkinson's disease (PD). The prevalence of PG is 2.2%-7% in treated PD patients, which is higher than the background population rate. As other non motor symptoms in PD, PG is frequently under-reported by patients and caregivers and may be under-recognized by the treating physicians. Factors associated with PG include male sex, younger age or younger age at PD onset, personal or family history of substance abuse or ICD, a personality profile characterized by impulsiveness, and treatment with dopamine agonists (DA) more than with levodopa (l-dopa). The DA effect seems to be a class effect and not specific for any DA. Neurofunctional studies suggest that medication-induced downregulation of frontostriatal connections and upregulation of striatum might combine to induce impulsive behavior. A dysfunction of fronto-subcortical circuits in PD patients with PG is also supported by neuropsychological findings of impaired executive control and monitoring abilities. Management of ICDs in PD is complex, and until now only discontinuation and/or tapering of DA treatment seem to be an effective management strategy for ICDs in PD. There is no empirical evidence supporting the use of psychiatric drugs for PG such as antipsychotics and antidepressants. Data regarding the effect of deep brain stimulation (DBS), particularly of subthalamic nucleus, on PG and ICDs in PD are still limited and sometimes conflicting since improvement of PG or new onset of PG after surgery have been reported. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Parkinsonism and Related Disorders,Jul-13

treatment response","The power of a placebo to effect clinically meaningful neurobiological change comparable to pharmacological therapies has been demonstrated, although the mechanisms are not fully understood. Predicting placebo responsiveness has only recently received more attention, but psychological disposition, contextual and biological factors are now known to dramatically affect a person's susceptibility to the placebo effect. The placebo effect depends upon expectancies that can be modified in a number of ways, including conditioning through explicit or implicit learned associations. Based on the dopaminergic response to anticipation of benefit in Parkinson's disease, it was suggested that the placebo effect can be seen as analogous to the expectation of reward. Dopaminergic pathways have since been implicated in the placebo response in pain and depression. Additionally, endogenous opioid release is known to mediate many forms of placebo analgesia. We provide an overview of the mechanisms and the therapeutic implications of the placebo effect in neurological and psychiatric conditions. We include evidence for detrimental effects arising from seemingly inert interventions, termed the 'nocebo effect.' Neuroimaging has critically advanced the study of the placebo effect and provides some of the strongest evidence for the mechanisms of this phenomenon prevalent across an array of human health-related circumstances. This review specifically focuses on mechanisms of the placebo effect in the three conditions that have most significantly demonstrated this effect and for which a plausible physiological basis can be identified: pain, PD and depression. Other neurological and psychiatric diseases reviewed include multiple sclerosis, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and epilepsy. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",Pharmacology and Therapeutics,Dec-13

Physiological and electrical stimulations as well as plasticity-modifying molecular agents may facilitate functional recovery by selectively enhancing existing neural circuits or promoting the formation of new functional circuits.

Self-awareness and self-control have been attributed to these regions. To test the hypothesis that they are dysfunctional in pathological gamblingwith poor self-control, we studied gamblers with and without previous stimulant abuse and age- and sex-matched controls. We found that pathological gamblers were more impulsive than controls in a stopsignal task and attributed this to changes in the activity of the paralimbic network: Pathological gamblers had reduced synchronization at rest in the high gamma range (55-100 Hz) compared with controls and failed to show an increase in gamma synchronization during rest compared with the task, as observed in controls. Subgroup analysis revealed that pathological gamblerswithout a history of stimulant abuse had lower PCC power during the stop-signal task compared with controls and gamblers with previous stimulant abuse. Furthermore, gamblers with a history of stimulant abuse had up to four times higher power at the ACC site during rest and the task compared with controls. In conclusion, pathological gamblers had higher impulsivity and functional paralimbic abnormalities, which could not be explained by a history of stimulant abuse. In addition, previous stimulant abuse had a marked effect on the amplitude of oscillatory brain activity in the ACC and PCC, suggesting long-term deleterious effects of repeated dopaminergic drug exposure. These consequences should be investigated in more detail in longitudinal studies.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,19-Mar-13

In the field of psychiatric disorders, DBS has been first used for obsessive compulsive disorder and treatment-resistant depression. Only recently it has been proposed for the treatment of addiction. Whatever the disease, the selected target is a constant question. In this review, we present theoretical, empirical and technical arguments in favor of targeting the subthalamic nucleus as the best candidate over other areas for DBS in the treatment of drug addiction. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Current Opinion in Neurobiology,Aug-13

Psychosocial and pharmaceutical treatments have shown modest results on smoking cessation rates, but there is an urgent need to develop treatments with greater efficacy. Brain stimulation methods are gaining increasing interest as possible addiction therapeutics. Objective(s): The purpose of this paper is to review the studies that have evaluated brain stimulation techniques on tobacco addiction, and discuss future directions for research in this novel area of addiction interventions. Method(s): Electronic and manual literature searches identified fifteen studies that administered repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), cranial electrostimulation (CES), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) or deep brain stimulation (DBS). Result(s): rTMS was found to be the most well studied method with respect to tobacco addiction. Results indicate that rTMS and tDCS targeted to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) were the most efficacious in reducing tobacco cravings, an effect that may be mediated through the brain reward system involved in tobacco addiction. While rTMS was shown to reduce consumption of cigarettes, as yet no brain stimulation technique has been shown to significantly increase abstinence rates. It is possible that the therapeutic effects of rTMS and tDCS may be improved by optimization of stimulation parameters and increasing the duration of treatment. Conclusion(s): Although further studies are needed to confirm the ability of brain stimulation methods to treat tobacco addiction, this review indicates that rTMS and tDCS both represent potentially novel treatment modalities. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Various theories have been developed to integrate the clinical phenotype into a strong neurobiological framework. One theory describes schizophrenia as a disorder of impaired neural plasticity. Recently, non-invasive brain stimulation techniques have garnered much attention to their ability to modulate plasticity and treat schizophrenia. The aim of this review is to introduce the basic physiological principles of conventional non-invasive brain stimulation techniques and to review the available evidence for schizophrenia. Despite promising evidence for efficacy in a large number of clinical trials, we continue to have a rudimentary understanding of the underlying neurobiology. Additional investigation is required to improve the response rates to non-invasive brain stimulation, to reduce the interindividual variability and to improve the understanding of non-invasive brain stimulation in schizophrenia. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",European Archives of Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience,Dec-13

systematic review","Background and Objectives:Obesity is emerging as the most significant health concern of the twenty-first century. A wealth of neuroimaging data suggest that weight gain might be related to aberrant brain function, particularly in prefrontal cortical regions modulating mesolimbic addictive responses to food. Nevertheless, food addiction is currently a model hotly debated. Here, we conduct a meta-analysis of neuroimaging data, examining the most common functional differences between normal-weight and obese participants in response to food stimuli.Data Source:We conducted a search using several journal databases and adhered to the 'Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses' (PRISMA) method. To this aim, 10 studies were found with a total of 126 obese participants, 129 healthy controls, equaling 184 foci (146 increased, 38 decreased activation) using the Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) technique. Out of the 10 studies, 7 investigated neural responses to food versus non-food images. Result(s):In response to food images, obese in comparison to healthy weight subjects had increased activation in the left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, right parahippocampal gyrus, right precentral gyrus and right anterior cingulate cortex, and reduced activation in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and left insular cortex. Conclusion(s):Prefrontal cortex areas linked to cognitive evaluation processes, such as evaluation of rewarding stimuli, as well as explicit memory regions, appear most consistently activated in response to images of food in those who are obese. Conversely, a reduced activation in brain regions associated with cognitive control and interoceptive awareness of sensations in the body might indicate a weakened control system, combined with hypo-sensitivity to satiety and discomfort signals after eating in those who are prone to overeat. © 2013 Brooks et al.",PLoS ONE,10-Apr-13

Furthermore, artistic creativity may emerge in art-naive PD patients treated with levodopa and dopamine agonists. The present review discusses reported PD patients who developed enhanced artistic skills under anti-Parkinsonian therapy and the course of this phenomenon in the clinical context. It is unclear whether creative drive is related to dopamine dysregulation, and the mechanisms remain speculative. The delineation of the particular constellation that enables this emergence in PD patients may shed light on the comprehension of the concept of creativity in general. © 2013 American Psychological Association.",Behavioral Neuroscience,Apr-13

These new applications confer a huge therapeutic potential in diseases for which often no treatment exists or which are refractory to existing therapies. This spread of applications, however, implies ethical problems in several domains: clinical use, research and presentation in the media and public. Thus, a systematic ethical analysis is needed to inform and guide this process. In this article we identify ethical problems involved in research and clinical use of novel DBS applications, suggest criteria and distinctions for structuring the ethical analysis, and articulate ethical demands for DBS research of novel applications. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.",Nervenarzt,Oct-13

The analysis reported here was undertaken with the primary goal of examining whether there is a relationship between peri-operative complications and age. The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Rockville, MD, USA) was queried for 10 years beginning in 1999 for patients undergoing deep brain stimulator insertion, pallidotomy, and thalamotomy for treatment of PD, essential tremor, and dystonia. Inpatient complications, including death, stroke (both ischemic and hemorrhagic), and other overall complications were examined. The relative risks associated with advanced age; primary diagnosis; treatment modality; the diagnoses of hypertension, diabetes, and nicotinism; and the cumulative number of comorbidities were examined. There were 5464 patients who met inclusion criteria, including 4145 patients treated for PD and 4961 patients treated with deep brain stimulation (DBS). Overall in-hospital mortality was 0.26%, with 0.15% related to surgical factors. There was a correlation between in-hospital mortality, increasing age, and number of medical comorbidities. After multivariate regression no factor remained predictive of mortality. Having more than 1 medical comorbidity or PD increased the risk of in-hospital complications. Patients with PD were more likely to suffer hemorrhage or stroke. Hypertension, diabetes, nicotinism, and modality of treatment were not associated with increased mortality, hemorrhage or stroke risk, or in-hospital mortality in univariate or multivariate analysis. Both age and medical comorbidity are correlated with in-hospital complications, but age appears to serve as a surrogate for comorbidity. Surgery for PD appears to carry an increased risk of hemorrhage or stroke and in-hospital complications. © 2013 Movement Disorder Society.",Movement Disorders,Oct-13

The goal of current study is to identify the long-term impact of STN-DBS for young onset PD (YOPD) patients. Methods 17 YOPD patients with a mean disease onset at 32.3 years were prospectively followed up at 1, 2, 5 and 7 years after STN-DBS. Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) was evaluated in 4 combinations of Med/DBS on/off. Results UPDRS part II-IV improved significantly 7 years after operation. While a slowly progressive worsening of levodopa response on part III, synergistic effect of medication and stimulation consistently improves motor disabilities. STN-DBS could remarkably reduce levodopa equivalent daily dose at 7 years. The morbidity rates were low. However, these patients seem to have more transient stimulation dyskinesia (47.1%) and dopamine dysregulation syndrome (11.8%) after surgery. Conclusions STN-DBS remains effective to improve motor disabilities over 7 years for YOPD and is a safe procedure concerning cognitive outcome and morbidity. However, stimulation dyskinesia and dopamine dysregulation syndrome deserve attention for the causal relationship between DBS surgery and behavioral outcomes. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Clinical Neurology and Neurosurgery,Oct-13

To study the clinical features and treatment responses of patients with homozygous or heterozygous Parkin mutations, we performed a retrospective chart review in six early-onset parkinsonism patients with pathogenic Parkin mutations. The clinical phenotypes observed in this cohort, all drawn from different families, were variable. All patients had a slowly progressive form of parkinsonism that responded well to dopaminergic therapy with the exception of one advanced case. Homozygous patients had an earlier age at disease onset than heterozygous patients. Two of our patients underwent bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus or globus pallidus leading to a sustained positive response. Our observations support an earlier age of onset for homozygous cases and possible beneficial effects of DBS in Parkin-related parkinsonism. © 2013 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.",International Journal of Neuroscience,Dec-13

The versatility of DBS as both a probe and modulator of neural circuits is making it a powerful tool to study the human brain, helping provide important details of the pathophysiology of circuit dysfunction. We are currently in a phase of active investigation to determine which circuits and disorders could be treated with DBS.

Concurrent with physical and emotional symptoms, pain-related cognitive impairment has been reported. Although opioid analgesics are frequently prescribed, concern exists that opioids possess adverse cognitive effects of their own. OBJECTIVE(S): To review the neuropsychological and neuroanatomical sequelae of chronic non-malignant pain and opioid therapy, to clarify roles and benefits of neuropsychological assessment in a chronic pain population, and to provide recommendations for clinical practice and future research. METHOD(S): This non-systematic review sought to provide a comprehensive synthesis of relevant neurobiology, neuroimaging, neuropsychological, and rehabilitation research literatures. We included citations from seminal and current texts as well as relevant original and review articles from 1980-2012 in PubMed and PubMedCentral online research databases. DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY/CONCLUSIONS: To date, evidence from opioid studies suggests only mild deficits in specific cognitive domains (e.g., memory, attention/concentration) and only under specific conditions (e.g., dose escalations). Additionally, neuroimaging and neuropsychological evidence suggests that pain itself results in cognitive sequelae. Methodological improvements in future research will allow for better delineation of the contributing effects of pain and opioids, with an overall goal of improving evidence-based clinical treatment recommendations. © 2013 - IOS Press and the authors.

university","Introduction: The synthesis and characterization of new highly potent and selective dopamine (DA) D3 receptor antagonists has permitted to characterize the role of the DA D3 receptor in the control of drug-seeking behavior and in the pathophysiology of impulse control disorders and schizophrenia. Areas covered: In the present review, the authors will first describe most recent classes of DA D3 receptor antagonists by reviewing about 43 patent applications during the 2007-2012 period; they will then outline the biological rationale in support of the use of selective DA D3 receptor antagonists in the treatment of drug addiction, impulse control disorders and schizophrenia. Expert opinion: The strongest clinical application and potential for selective DA D3 receptor antagonists lies in the reduction of drug-induced incentive motivation, the attenuation of drug's rewarding efficacy and the reduction in reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior triggered either by re-exposure to the drug itself, re-exposure to environmental cues that had been previously associated with drug-taking behavior or stress. The selectivity of these antagonists together with reduced lipophilicity (minimizing unspecific binding), increased brain penetration and improved physico-chemical profile are all key factors for clinical efficacy and safety. © Informa UK, Ltd.",Expert Opinion on Therapeutic Patents,Mar-13

To date, the primary means of acting on this region has been with pharmacological interventions or implanted electrodes. Here we introduce a new noninvasive brain stimulation technique that exploits the highly interconnected nature of the midbrain and prefrontal cortex to stimulate deep brain regions. Using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the prefrontal cortex, we were able to remotely activate the interconnected midbrain and cause increases in participants' appraisals of facial attractiveness. Participants with more enhanced prefrontal/midbrain connectivity following stimulation exhibited greater increases in attractiveness ratings. These results illustrate that noninvasive direct stimulation of prefrontal cortex can induce neural activity in the distally connected midbrain, which directly effects behavior. Furthermore, these results suggest that this tDCS protocol could provide a promising approach to modulate midbrain functions that are disrupted in neuropsychiatric disorders. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.",Translational Psychiatry,2013

The therapeutic efficacy and relative lack of serious side effects resulted in the expansion of DBS into the treatment of many other diseases, including obsessive-compulsive disorder, Tourette's, and depression, among others. More recently, a limited number of basic and clinical studies indicated that DBS may also be useful in the treatment of various addictions. Objective(s): Here, we briefly summarize the history of DBS and review the basic and clinical studies focused on DBS and addiction. We also examine the potential mechanisms that may underlie the effects of DBS. Result(s) and Conclusion(s): The available data indicate that DBS is a promising therapeutic modality for the treatment of addiction. Thus far, the nucleus accumbens and subthalamic nucleus are the most promising sites for DBS, reversing aspects of addiction. The mechanisms underlying DBS are complex and likely vary from region to region. Emerging evidence indicates that DBS of the nucleus accumbens produces its effects, at least in part, by antidromic activation of cortico-accumbal afferents that stimulate inhibitory medial prefrontal cortex interneurons via recurrent collaterals. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Psychopharmacology,Oct-13

Although this aspect of drug action usually remains in the shadows, drug-induced alterations in brain temperature reflect their metabolic neural effects and affect neural activity and neural functions. Objective(s): Here, I review brain temperature changes induced by neuroactive drugs, which are used therapeutically (general anesthetics), as a research tool (dopamine agonists and antagonists), and self-administered to induce desired psychic effects (cocaine, methamphetamine, ecstasy). I consider the mechanisms underlying these temperature fluctuations and their influence on neural, physiological, and behavioral effects of these drugs. Result(s): By interacting with neural mechanisms regulating metabolic activity and heat exchange between the brain and the rest of the body, neuroactive drugs either increase or decrease brain temperatures both within (35-39 C) and exceeding the range of physiological fluctuations. These temperature effects differ drastically depending upon the environmental conditions and activity state during drug administration. This state-dependence is especially important for drugs of abuse that are usually taken by humans during psycho-physiological activation and in environments that prevent proper heat dissipation from the brain. Under these conditions, amphetamine-like stimulants induce pathological brain hyperthermia (>40 C) associated with leakage of the blood-brain barrier and structural abnormalities of brain cells. Conclusion(s): The knowledge on brain temperature fluctuations induced by neuroactive drugs provides new information to understand how they influence metabolic neural activity, why their effects depend upon the behavioral context of administration, and the mechanisms underlying adverse drug effects including neurotoxicity. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg (outside the USA).",Psychopharmacology,Feb-13

According to the criteria of both the ICD-10 and the DSM-IV, the presence of this symptom is crucial for the diagnosis of depressive disorders. In recent years scientific approaches using animal studies and projects of functional imaging have allowed the development of a new concept of the pathophysiology of anhedonia. The hypothesis that functional changes within the mesolimbic reward system could represent the neural correlate of anhedonia has contributed to a new concept of depressive disorders and allows testing of new therapeutic options for patients suffering from very resistant forms of depression. By using the method of deep brain stimulation present clinical studies try to ascertain whether the symptom of anhedonia can be alleviated by influencing the neural activity of the reward system. This article will give a critical overview about the background for new therapeutic approaches and illuminates the results of these studies. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Nervenarzt,May-13

Deep brain stimulation represents an important extension of therapeutic options by which invasive electrodes are implanted in various subcortical brain areas in order to achieve an improvement in motor and psychiatric symptoms by high frequency stimulation. Up to 2012 approximately 100,000 patients had been treated with deep brain stimulation worldwide. The indications for deep brain stimulation were essentially already established indications, such as idiopathic Parkinson's syndrome, dystonia and tremors. The newer indications which include in particular psychiatric symptoms, such as depression, obsessive diseases, addiction and Tourette syndrome, are as yet limited to approximately 5 % of treated patients. An increasingly better understanding of the system physiology of neurological and psychiatric diseases has promoted the search for new target areas and indications for treatment by neuromodulation.

Many researches have established the significance of experiencing consumption desire in addiction. This study aimed at assessing the effect of repeated magnetic stimulus from skull (rTMS) on decrease of desire of drug abuse in addicts to metamphetamine (MA). Material(s) and Method(s): In this study, a semi-experimental design with a 'pretest'-'posttest' control group was used. The samples included 20 subjects with the desire to abuse MA in spring and summer of 2011. Based on available sampling method the cases were placed under the stimulus of repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on pre forehead of right hemisphere (frequency of 10 Hrz) and left hemisphere (frequency of 1 Hrz) for 20 sessions (30 minutes). The subjects were evaluated using the desire for drug questionnaire (DDQ) before initiating treatment, by the end of 20th session and 1.5 month after treatment. The data was then analyzed using covariance analysis in SPSS. Result(s): rTMS significantly decreased the desire to abuse drug in addicts to MA which continued until 1.5 month after treatment. Conclusion(s): Findings showed the effective influence of rTMS on reducing the desire for drug abuse, so it is suggested as a useful approach for treatment programs of drug abusers.",Journal of Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences,2013

Cost-effectiveness (CE) studies represent one of the basic tools to achieve this goal. Aim(s): To present the current state of Health Technology Assessment (HTA) and health economics in mental health in Brazil and its importance to the decision-making process. Methodology: Descriptive paper on HTA and health economics in Brazil. Databases from government and universities as well as some scientific databases to assess the information are presented. Results and Conclusion(s): Economic analysis to evaluate interventions in mental health care is a relatively recent addition to the field of health economics; in Brazil, it is also considered a topic within Epidemiology research area. There have been an increased number of studies developed in high-income countries. However, there are fewer CE studies in low- and middle-income ones. Psychiatric disorders represent a significant burden in developing countries, where resources devoted to health care are even scarcer. © 2013 Informa UK, Ltd.",Journal of Mental Health,Apr-13

*reward",The question of whether (or to what degree) obesity reflects addiction to high-energy foods often narrows to the question of whether the overeating of these foods causes the same long-term neuroadaptations as are identified with the late stages of addiction. Of equal or perhaps greater interest is the question of whether common brain mechanisms mediate the acquisition and development of eating and drug-taking habits. The earliest evidence on this question is rooted in early studies of brain stimulation reward. Lateral hypothalamic electrical stimulation can be reinforcing in some conditions and can motivate feeding in others. That stimulation of the same brain region should be both reinforcing and drive inducing is paradoxical; why should an animal work to induce a drive-like state such as hunger? This is known as the drive-reward paradox. Insights into the substrates of the drive-reward paradox suggest an answer to the controversial question of whether the dopamine system - a system downstream from the stimulated fibers of the lateral hypothalamus - is more critically involved in wanting or in liking of various rewards including food and addictive drugs. That the same brain circuitry is implicated in the motivation for and the reinforcement by both food and addictive drugs extends the argument for a common mechanism underlying compulsive overeating and compulsive drug taking. © 2013 Society of Biological Psychiatry.,Biological Psychiatry,01-May-13

To review and discuss studies that have investigated the effects of treating addiction by means of electroencephalography (EEG) neurofeedback, real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI) neurofeedback, transcranial magnetic stimulation/transcranial direct current stimulation (TMS/tDCS) and deep brain stimulation (DBS). We reviewed the literature, focusing on Dutch studies in particular. Studies using EEG neurofeedback were shown to have positive effects on drug use, treatment compliance, and cue reactivity in patients with cocaine and alcohol dependence. A pilot study investigating the effects of rt-fMRI neurofeedback on nicotine dependent patients showed that modulation of the anterior cingulate cortex can decrease smokers' craving for nicotine. In several studies decreased craving was found in alcohol dependent patients after TMS or tDCS stimulation of the anterior cingulate cortex or the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The first DBS pilot studies suggest that the nucleus accumbens is a promising target region for the treatment of alcohol and heroin dependence. Neuromodulation provides us with a unique opportunity to directly apply neuroscientific knowledge to the treatment of addiction. However, more research is needed to ensure the efficacy, safety and feasibility of the various neuromodulation techniques that are now available.",Tijdschrift voor psychiatrie,2013

young adult","The consequences of chronic alcohol dependence cause important health and economic burdens worldwide. Relapse rates after standard treatment (medication and psychotherapy) are high. There is evidence from in vivo investigations and from studies in patients that the brain's reward system is critically involved in the development and maintenance of addictive behavior, suggesting that modification of this system could significantly improve the prognosis of addictive patients. Motivated by an accidental observation, we used the nucleus accumbens (NAc), which has a central position in the dopaminergic reward system for deep brain stimulation (DBS) of alcohol addiction. We report our first experiences with NAc DBS for alcohol dependence and review the literature addressing the mechanisms leading to addiction. Five patients were treated off-label with bilateral NAc DBS for severe alcohol addiction (average follow-up 38 months). All patients experienced significant and ongoing improvement of craving. Two patients remained completely abstinent for more than 4 years. NAc stimulation was tolerated without permanent side effects. Simultaneous recording of local field potentials from the target area and surface electroencephalography while patients performed neuropsychological tasks gave a hint on the pivotal role of the NAc in processing alcohol-related cues. To our knowledge, the data presented here reflect the first attempt to treat alcohol-addicted patients with NAc DBS. Electrical NAc stimulation probably counterbalances the effect of drug-related stimuli triggering involuntarily drug-seeking behavior. Meanwhile, two prospective clinical studies using randomized, double-blind, and crossover stimulation protocols for DBS are underway to corroborate these preliminary results.

Unfortunately, its underlying mechanisms are not fully understood, and pharmacological, psychological, or social interventions often fail to achieve long-lasting remission. Next to genetic, social, and contextual factors, a substance-induced dysfunction of the brain's reward system is considered a decisive factor for the establishment and maintenance of addiction. Due to its successful application and approval for several neurological disorders, deep brain stimulation (DBS) is known as a powerful tool for modulating dysregulated networks and has also been considered for substance addiction. Initial promising case reports of DBS in alcohol and heroin addiction in humans have recently been published. Likewise, results from animal studies mimicking different kinds of substance addiction point in a similar direction. The objective of this review is to provide an overview of the published results on DBS in addiction, and to discuss whether these preliminary results justify further research, given the novelty of this treatment approach. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Handbook of Clinical Neurology,2013

These patients face reduced quality of life, high risk of suicide, and little hope of recovery. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is under scientific evaluation as a new treatment option for these treatment-resistant patients. First clinical studies with small samples have been stimulated at the subgenual cingulate gyrus (Cg25/24), the anterior limb of the capsula interna (ALIC), and the nucleus accumbens (NAcc). Long-term antidepressant effects, augmentation of social functioning, and normalization of brain metabolism have been shown in about 50% of patients. Cognitive safety regarding attention, learning, and memory has been reported. Adverse events were wound infection, suicide, and hypomania, amongst others. Larger studies are under way to confirm these preliminary encouraging results. New hypothesis-guided targets (e.g., medial forebrain bundle, habenula) are about to be assessed in clinical trials. The application of DBS for other psychiatric diseases (e.g., bipolar disorder, alcohol dependency, opioid addiction, schizophrenia) is debated and single case studies are under way. Standards are needed for study registration, target selection, patient inclusion and monitoring, and publication of results to guarantee safety for the patients and scientific exchange. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Handbook of Clinical Neurology,2013

transcranial magnetic stimulation","Over the past few years the use of stimulants such as methylphenidate and modafinil among the student population has attracted considerable debate in the pages of bioethics journals. Under the rubric of cognitive enhancement, bioethicists have discussed this use of stimulants-along with future technologies of enhancement-and have launched a sometimes forceful debate of such practices. In the following paper, it is argued that even if we focus solely upon current practices, the term cognitive enhancement encompasses a wide range of ethical considerations that can usefully be addressed without the need for speculation. In taking this position it is suggested that we divide cognitive enhancement into a series of empirically-constructed frameworks- medical risks and benefits, self-medication and under-prescription, prescription drug abuse and overmedication, and finally, the intention to cognitively enhance. These are not mutually exclusive frameworks, but provide a way in which to identify the scope of the issue at hand and particular ethical and medical questions that may be relevant to enhancement. By a process of elimination it is suggested that we can indeed talk of cognitive enhancement as an observable set of practices. However, in doing so we should be aware of how academic commentaries and discussion may be seen as both capturing reality and reifying cognitive enhancement as an entity. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.",Neuroethics,Aug-12

working memory","Heavy alcohol use has numerous negative impacts on cognition. In many cases, it appears that excess drinking influences working memory, problem solving, attention, patterns of regional brain activation, and even gray and white matter volume. Due to these effects, most significant conclusions related to cognitive decline are limited to the assumption that ""more is worse."" However, heavy alcohol use is a very complex psychosocial behavior and is subject to a problematic number of variables. As a result, it is very difficult to extend generalizations about drinking-related consequences to the overall population since many environmental and biological differences come into play for every individual. Three of these variables shown to have significant impact on cognitive sensitivity to alcohol are age of first alcohol use (age of drinking initiation), specific pattern of alcohol consumption and gender. Potential insight can be gained into how individual drinking scenarios differ in risk for cognitive decline by assessing how each of these important factors influences cognition independently. Although some overlap exists between categories, each still appears to contribute unique influence on likelihood and presentation of cognition-related effects. Based on existing and current research, age and gender tend to augment baseline sensitivity to alcohol, with patterns of alcohol intake also influencing how changes appear. Given these categorical differences, it is important to consider personal alcohol drinking history rather than just aggregate alcohol intake as risk factors in the cognitive impacts of drinking. The objective of this brief review is to examine the role of these factors on the effect of alcohol on cognition. © 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.",Current Drug Abuse Reviews,Jun-12

withdrawal syndrome","Impulse control disorders (ICDs), a group of complex behavioral disorders, occur more commonly in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients than in the general population, with a reported prevalence up to 13.6% in some studies. The most common ICDs reported are pathological gambling (PG), hypersexuality (HS), compulsive shopping and compulsive eating. More than a quarter of the patients with ICDs have 2 or more behavioral addictions. These abnormal behaviors impair activities of daily living and have a negative impact on quality of life of patients and their families. As with many other non motor symptoms in PD, ICDs are frequently under-reported by patients and caregivers and may be under-recognized by the treating physicians. Treatment with dopamine agonists (DA) is the main risk factor for developing ICDs, and stimulation of mesolimbic D3 receptors by DA is thought to underlie their development. The DA effect seems to be a class effect and not specific for any DA. Levodopa can also induce ICDs but much less so than the DAs. The management of ICDs in PD is complex. Modifications in dopaminergic drug treatment are frequently necessary. In some cases alternative therapies such as atypical antipsychotics, antidepressants or deep brain stimulation if motor symptoms become incapacitating after adjustment of dopamine replacement therapy should be considered. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Parkinsonism and Related Disorders,Jan-12

A second wave of targets came from basic research, enabled by the low morbidity, reversibility, and adaptability of DBS. This was the case for the subthalamic nucleus (STN) which improves the triad of dopaminergic symptoms, and the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) for gait disorders in PD. The new concepts of the role of basal ganglia in psychiatric disorders indicate the subgenual cortex CG 25 for severe resistant depression, the accumbens nucleus for depression, anorexia nervosa, and addiction, and the thalamus intralaminar nuclei for minimally conscious states. Serendipity and a scientific approach have provided several instances where targets have produced unexpected effects (such as STN in OCD), as well as limbic effects observed during attempts at VMH stimulation for obesity: this might offer a novel way to treat mild cognitive impairment, or memory deficits reported in Alzheimer's disease. While these might provide solutions for as yet unsolved problems, attention must be paid to ethical considerations. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Parkinsonism and Related Disorders,Jan-12

transcranial magnetic stimulation","Major depressive disorder (MDD) and cardiovascular diseases are intimately associated. Depression is an independent risk factor for mortality in cardiovascular samples. Neuroendocrine dysfunctions in MDD are related to an overactive hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and increased sympathetic activity. Novel intervention strategies for MDD include the non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). In fact, although these techniques have being increasingly used as a treatment for MDD, their cardiovascular effects were not sufficiently investigated, which would be important considering the dyad MDD/cardiovascular disorders. We investigated this issue through a systematic review for published articles from the first date available to May 2012 in MEDLINE and other databases, looking for main risk factors and surrogate markers for cardiovascular disease such as: cortisol, heart rate variability (HRV), alcohol, smoking, obesity, hypertension, glucose. We identified 37 articles (981 subjects) according to our eligibility criteria. Our main findings were that NIBS techniques might be effective strategies for down-regulating HPA activity and regulating food, alcohol, and cigarette consumption. NIBS's effects on HRV and blood pressure presented mixed findings, with studies suggesting that HRV values can decrease or remain unchanged after NIBS, while one study found that rTMS increased blood pressure levels. Also, a single study showed that glucose levels decrease after tDCS. However, most studies tested the acute effects after one single session of rTMS/tDCS; therefore further studies are necessary to investigate whether NIBS modifies cardiovascular risk factors in the long-term. In fact, considering the burden of cardiac disease, further trials in cardiovascular, depressed, and non-depressed samples using NIBS should be performed. © 2012 Sampaio, Fraguas, Lotufo, Bensenor and Brunoni.",Frontiers in Psychiatry,2012

weight reduction","Background: Despite optimum medical management, many patients with Parkinson's disease are incapacitated by gait disorders including freezing of gait. We aimed to assess whether methylphenidate-through its combined action on dopamine and noradrenaline reuptake-would improve gait disorders and freezing of gate in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease without dementia who also received subthalamic nucleus stimulation. Method(s): This multicentre, parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised trial was done in 13 movement disorders departments in France between October, 2009, and December, 2011. Eligible patients were younger than 80 years and had Parkinson's disease, severe gait disorders, and freezing of gate despite optimised treatment of motor fluctuations with dopaminergic drugs and subthalamic stimulation. We randomly assigned patients (1:1 with a computer random-number generator in blocks of four) to receive methylphenidate (1 mg/kg per day) or placebo capsules for 90 days. Patients, their carers, study staff, investigators, and data analysts were masked to treatment allocation. To control for confounding effects of levodopa we assessed patients under standardised conditions with an acute levodopa challenge. Our primary outcome was a change in the number of steps during the stand-walk-sit (SWS) test without levodopa. We compared the respective mean numbers of steps at day 90 in the methylphenidate and placebo groups in a covariance analysis and adjusted for baseline differences. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00914095. Finding(s): We screened 81 patients and randomly assigned 35 to receive methylphenidate and 34 to receive placebo. 33 patients in the methylphenidate group and 32 patients in the placebo group completed the study. Efficacy outcomes were assessed in the patients who completed the study. Compared with patients in the placebo group (median 33 steps [IQR 26-45]), the patients in the methylphenidate group made fewer steps at 90 days (31 [26-42], F(1, 62)=6.1, p=0.017, adjusted size effect 0.61). Adverse events were analysed in all randomly assigned patients. There were significantly more adverse events in the methylphenidate group compared with placebo. Patients on methylphenidate had a significant increase in heart rate (mean 3.6 [SD 7.2] beats per min) and decrease in weight (mean 2.2 [SD 1.8] kg) compared with the placebo group. Interpretation(s): Methylphenidate improved gait hypokinesia and freezing in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease receiving subthalamic nucleus stimulation. Methylphenidate represents a therapeutic option in the treatment of gait disorders at the advanced stage of Parkinson's disease. The long term risk-benefit balance should be further studied.

The aim of this paper is to review the therapeutic options for treating resistant major depressive disorder, as well as evaluating further therapeutic options. Method(s): In addition to Google Scholar and Quertle searches, a PubMed search using key words was conducted, and relevant articles published in English peer-reviewed journals (1990-2011) were retrieved. Only those papers that directly addressed treatment options for treatment-resistant depression were retained for extensive review. Result(s): Treatment-resistant depression, a complex clinical problem caused by multiple risk factors, is targeted by integrated therapeutic strategies, which include optimization of medications, a combination of antidepressants, switching of antidepressants, and augmentation with non-antidepressants, psychosocial and cultural therapies, and somatic therapies including electroconvulsive therapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, magnetic seizure therapy, deep brain stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation, and vagus nerve stimulation. As a corollary, more than a third of patients with treatment-resistant depression tend to achieve remission and the rest continue to suffer from residual symptoms. The latter group of patients needs further study to identify the most effective therapeutic modalities. Newer biomarker-based antidepressants and other drugs, together with non-drug strategies, are on the horizon to address further the multiple complex issues of treatment-resistant depression. Conclusion(s): Treatment-resistant depression continues to challenge mental health care providers, and further relevant research involving newer drugs is warranted to improve the quality of life of patients with the disorder. © 2012 Al-Harbi, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.",Patient Preference and Adherence,2012

stereotaxic surgery","Background Stereotactic surgery has been used to treat heroin abstinence in China since 2000 by ablating the amygdaloid nucleus (AMY) and the nucleus accumbens (NAc), which also provides opportunity to identify the relationship between these nuclei and addiction. Our study aimed to explore the physiological and psychological effects of electrically stimulating the AMY and the NAc in heroin addicts after detoxification by observing changes of heart rate, arterial pressure and occurrence of euphoria similar to heroin induced euphoria. Methods A total of 70 heroin addicts after detoxification were recruited, and 61 of them were eligible to be given stereotactic surgery for heroin abstinence. The operation was carried out after determining the coordinates of all target nucleuses, and stimulation was performed at the AMY and the NAc solely or jointly. Heart rate, arterial pressure and occurrence of euphoria similar to heroin induced euphoria were recorded and analyzed. Results The average heat rate was (66+/-10) beats/min before electric stimulation, and significantly increased to (84+/-14) beats/min during stimulation, and changed to (73+/-12) beats/min 10 minutes after stimulation. There was a significant elevation of the average arterial pressure from 83 mmHg before stimulation to 98 mmHg during the stimulation, and it then decreased to 90 mmHg after stimulation. Forty-three of the 61 patients showed intense euphoria similar to heroin induced euphoria. The largest number (118/186) of euphoric responses occurred when the AMY and the NAc were stimulated at the same time. Odds ratio was 5.4 (95% CI: 2.4-11.9, P <0.0001) to quantify the association. Results from a Logistic regression model showed a positive correlation between unilateral stimulation of either the AMY or NAC and induction of euphoria (OR >1), especially when the left AMY or left NAc was stimulated (P <0.05). Conclusions Our data are consistent with existing results that the AMY and the NAc are related to addiction. Different roles in drug dependence would be suggested according to the location of the AMY and NAc.",Chinese Medical Journal,20120105

systematic review","Objective: We reviewed the clinical applications, academic communications, and specialized training required for deep brain stimulation (DBS) in China. Current problems and possible solutions also were discussed. Material(s) and Method(s): We reviewed all literature on DBS by Chinese authors. The WANFANG and PUBMED (2000-2009) data bases were searched to collect publications on DBS by Chinese authors. To compare the Chinese academic publications on DBS with those by American authors, data from publications by American authors also were collected. Information on the DBS population as categorized by year, by province, and by indication was collected from the Medtronic Neuromodulation data base. Result(s): From2000 to 2009, therewere 187 publications on DBS in Chinese journals and 23 in English journals by Chinese authors. American peers contributed 569 articles during the same period. In total, 2082 patients received DBS treatment in China by the end of 2009. Conclusion(s): DBS has evolved significantly during the past decade in China. There are still several problems. The advent of Chinese homemade DBS hardware, multidisciplinary cooperation, and the establishment of guidelines and regulations for DBS will improve the application of this surgical treatment in China. © 2012 International Neuromodulation Society.",Neuromodulation,May-June 2012

The management of patients with psychiatric disorders consists of drug therapy and/or psychotherapy. However, in some patients, these treatment modalities do not produce sufficient therapeutic effects or induce intolerable side effects. For these patients, neuromodulation has been suggested as a potential treatment modality. Neuromodulation includes deep brain stimulation, vagal nerve stimulation, and transcranial magnetic and electrical stimulation. The rationale for neuromodulation is derived from the research identifying neurobiologically localized substrates for refractory psychiatric symptoms. Here, we review the clinical data on neuromodulation in the major psychiatric disorders. Relevant data from animal models will also be discussed to explain the neurobiological basis of the therapy. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",,2012

withdrawal syndrome","Impulse control disorders (ICD) (most commonly pathologic gambling, hypersexuality, and uncontrollable spending) and compulsive behaviors can be triggered by dopaminergic therapies in Parkinson disease (PD). ICD are especially prevalent in patients receiving a dopamine agonist as part of their treatment regimen for PD, and have also been reported when dopamine agonists are used for other indications (e.g., restless legs syndrome). Although these iatrogenic disorders are common, affecting 1 in 7 patients with PD on dopamine agonists, they often elude detection by the treating physician. ICD lead to serious consequences, causing significant financial loss and psychosocial morbidity for many patients and families. ICD can appear at any time during treatment with dopamine agonists, sometimes within the first few months, but most often after years of treatment, particularly when patients receive dopamine agonists and levodopa together. In most cases ICD resolve if the dopamine agonist is withdrawn, and PD motor symptoms are managed with levodopa monotherapy. Familiarity with the clinical aspects, risk factors, pathophysiology, and management of ICD is essential for physicians using dopaminergic therapies to treat PD and other disorders.

ventromedial prefrontal cortex","Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an adjustable, reversible, non-destructive neurosurgical intervention using implanted electrodes to deliver electrical pulses to areas in the brain. DBS is currently investigated in psychiatry for the treatment of refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder, Tourette syndrome and depressive disorder. Although recent research in both animals and humans has indicated that DBS may be an effective intervention for patients with treatment-refractory addiction, it is not yet entirely clear which brain areas should be targeted. The objective of this review is to provide a systematic overview of the published literature on DBS and addiction and outline the most promising target areas using efficacy and adverse event data from both preclinical and clinical studies. We found 7 animal studies targeting six different brain areas: nucleus accumbens (NAc), subthalamic nucleus (STN), dorsal striatum, lateral habenula, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hypothalamus, and 11 human studies targeting two different target areas: NAc and STN. Our analysis of the literature suggests that the NAc is currently the most promising DBS target area for patients with treatment-refractory addiction. The mPFC is another promising target, but needs further exploration to establish its suitability for clinical purposes. We conclude the review with a discussion on translational issues in DBS research, medical ethical considerations and recommendations for clinical trials with DBS in patients with addiction. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.",Molecular Psychiatry,Jun-12

In contrast, decreases in mesolimbic dopamine function are observed during drug withdrawal, including cannabis-withdrawal syndrome. Thus, despite general misconceptions that cannabis is unique from other drugs of abuse, cannabis exerts identical effects on the mesolimbic dopamine system. The recent discovery that endogenous cannabinoids modulate the mesolimbic dopamine system, however, might be exploited for the development of potential pharmacotherapies designed to treat disorders of motivation. Indeed, disrupting endocannabinoid signaling decreases drug-induced increases in dopamine release in addition to dopamine concentrations evoked by conditioned stimuli during reward seeking. © 2012 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press all rights reserved.",Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Medicine,Aug-12

Whilst patients with certain personality traits, such as novelty-seeking behaviour, are more prone to develop these devastating behaviours, the biggest risk factor for impulsive compulsive and obsessive compulsive behaviours is dopamine-agonist therapy. Potential mechanisms and treatment strategies for ICBs in PD are discussed. Early recognition of ICBs in PD is crucial, in order to avoid social isolation and to prevent an ICB from becoming a habit.",Focus on Parkinson's Disease,2012

The cause of this disorder is unknown, but altered dopamine neurotransmission may be involved. Objective(s): We evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of the opioid antagonist naltrexone in the treatment of PG in PD. Method(s): Our cases included 3 patients with PD who developed PG after DA treatment. Result(s): Pathological gambling did not improve after reduction or discontinuation of DA. These patients responded poorly to serotonin reuptake inhibitors, whereas treatment with opioid antagonist naltrexone resulted in the remission of PG. Naltrexone treatment was well tolerated. In one patient, higher dose of naltrexone resulted in hepatic abnormalities, which resolved after dosage reduction. Conclusion(s): The opioid antagonist naltrexone could be an effective option for the treatment of PG in PD.

The subsequent extension of DBS to the subthalamic nucleus (STN), demonstrating its efficacy on virtually all symptoms of advanced Parkinson's disease (PD), sparked an era of intense clinical and research activities, eventually transcending PD and movement disorders to encompass mood and mind. Investigations of the role of DBS in a variety of neurological, psychiatric, cognitive, and behavioral conditions is ongoing. Serendipitous discoveries and advances in functional imaging are providing ""new"" brain targets for an increasing number of pathologies. Toward the end of this quarter of a century of DBS, there have been some indications that the field may be at risk of gliding down a slippery slope, reminiscent of the excesses of the old-era DBS. Although there are many reasons this year to celebrate the achievements of 25 years of modern DBS, there are also reasons to fear the opening of a new Pandora's box. © 2012 Movement Disorder Society.",Movement Disorders,Jun-12

review","To determine the success threshold at which a theoretical course of deep brain stimulation (DBS) would provide the same quality of life (QoL) and cost-effectiveness for heroin dependence as methadone maintenance treatment (MMT). We constructed a decision analysis model to calculate QoL after 6 months of MMT and compared it to a theoretical course of DBS. We also performed a cost-effectiveness analysis using societal costs of heroin dependence, MMT and DBS. Systematic literature review and meta-analysis. Patients (n = 1191) from 15 trials administering 6 months of MMT and patients (n = 2937) from 45 trials of DBS for movement disorders. Data on QoL before and after MMT, retention in MMT at 6 months, as well as complications of DBS and their impact on QoL in movement disorders. We found a QoL of 0.633 (perfect health = 1) in heroin addicts initiating MMT. Sixty-six per cent of patients completed MMT, but only 47% of them had opiate-free urine samples, resulting in an average QoL of 0.7148 (0.3574 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over 6 months). A trial of DBS is less expensive ($81,000) than untreated (or relapsed) heroin dependence ($100,000), but more expensive than MMT ($58,000). A theoretical course of DBS would need a success rate of 36.5% to match MMT, but a success rate of 49% to be cost-effective. The success rate, defined as the percentage of patients remaining heroin-free after 6 months of treatment, at which deep brain stimulation would be similarly cost-effective in treating opiate addiction to methadone maintenance treatment, is estimated at 49%. © 2011 The Authors, Addiction © 2011 Society for the Study of Addiction.","Addiction (Abingdon, England)",Mar-12

*schizophrenia / *therapy","Adult neurogenesis, the process of generating new neurons from neural stem cells, plays significant roles in synaptic plasticity, memory, and mood regulation. In the mammalian brain, it continues to occur well into adulthood in discrete regions, namely, the hippocampus and olfactory bulb. During the past decade, significant progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms regulating adult hippocampal neurogenesis and its role in the etiology of mental disorders. In addition, adult hippocampal neurogenesis is highly correlated with the remission of the antidepressant effect. In this paper, we discuss three major psychiatric disorders, depression, schizophrenia, and drug addiction, in light of preclinical evidence used in establishing the neurobiological significance of adult neurogenesis. We interpret the significance of these results and pose questions that remain unanswered. Potential treatments which include electroconvulsive therapy, deep brain stimulation, chemical antidepressants, and exercise therapy are discussed. While consensus lacks on specific mechanisms, we highlight evidence which indicates that these treatments may function via an increase in neural progenitor proliferation and changes to the hippocampal circuitry. Establishing a significant role of adult neurogenesis in the pathogenicity of psychiatric disorders may hold the key to potential strategies toward effective treatment. © 2012 Heechul Jun et al.",Neural Plasticity,2012

Behavioral data analysis revealed a less risky, more careful choice behavior under active DBS compared to DBS switched off. PET showed win- and loss-related activations in the paracingulate cortex, temporal poles, precuneus and hippocampus under active DBS, brain areas that have been implicated in action monitoring and behavioral control. Except for the temporal pole these activations were not seen when DBS was deactivated. These findings suggest that DBS of the NAcc may act partially by improving behavioral control. © 2012 Heldmann et al.",PLoS ONE,22-May-12

We aimed to investigate the effects of subthalamic nucleus (STN) and internal globus pallidus (GPi) deep brain stimulation (DBS) on ICD/DDS frequency and dopaminergic medication usage. Method(s): A retrospective chart review was performed on 159 individuals who underwent unilateral or bilateral PD DBS surgery in either STN or GPi. According to published criteria, pre- and post-operative records were reviewed to categorize patients both pre- and post-operatively as having ICD, DDS, both ICD and DDS, or neither ICD nor DDS. Group differences in patient demographics, clinical presentations, levodopa equivalent dose (LED), and change in diagnosis following unilateral/bilateral by brain target (STN or GPi DBS placement) were examined. Result(s): 28 patients met diagnostic criteria for ICD or DDS pre- or post-operatively. ICD or DDS classification did not differ by GPi or STN target stimulation. There was no change in DDS diagnosis after unilateral or bilateral stimulation. For ICD, diagnosis resolved in 2 of 7 individuals after unilateral or bilateral DBS. Post-operative development of these syndromes was significant; 17 patients developed ICD diagnoses post-operatively with 2 patients with pre-operative ICD developing DDS post-operatively. Conclusion(s): Unilateral or bilateral DBS did not significantly treat DDS or ICD in our sample, even though a few cases of ICD resolved post-operatively. Rather, our study provides preliminary evidence that DDS and ICD diagnoses may emerge following DBS surgery. © 2012 Moum et al.",PLoS ONE,25-Jan-12

Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale","Addictions to dopaminergic drugs or to pleasant behaviours are frequent and potentially devastating neuropsychiatric disorders observed in Parkinson's disease. They encompass impulse control disorders, punding and dopamine dysregulation syndrome. A relationship with dopaminergic treatment is strongly suggested. Subthalamic stimulation improves motor complications and allows for drastic reductions in medication. This treatment might, therefore, be considered for patients with behavioural addictions, when attempts to reduce dopaminergic medication have failed. However, conflicting data have reported suppression, alleviation, worsening or new onset of behavioural addictions after subthalamic stimulation. Non-motor fluctuations are also a disabling feature of the disease. We prospectively investigated behaviour in a cohort of 63 patients with Parkinson's disease, before and 1 year after subthalamic stimulation using the Ardouin scale, with systematic evaluation of functioning in overall appetitive or apathetic modes, non-motor fluctuations, dopaminergic dysregulation syndrome, as well as behavioural addictions (including impulse control disorders and punding) and compulsive use of dopaminergic medication. Defined drug management included immediate postoperative discontinuation of dopamine agonists and reduction in levodopa. Motor and cognitive statuses were controlled (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, frontal score). After surgery, the OFF medication motor score improved (-45.2), allowing for a 73 reduction in dopaminergic treatment, while overall cognitive evaluation was unchanged. Preoperative dopamine dysregulation syndrome had disappeared in 4/4, behavioural addictions in 17/17 and compulsive dopaminergic medication use in 9/9 patients. New onset of levodopa abuse occurred in one patient with surgical failure. Non-motor fluctuations were significantly reduced with improvements in off-dysphoria (P0.001) and reduction in on-euphoria (P0.001). There was an inversion in the number of patients functioning in an overall appetitive mode (29 before versus 2 after surgery, P0.0001) to an overall apathetic mode (3 before versus 13 after surgery, P<0.05). Two patients attempted suicide. Improvement in motor fluctuations is linked to the direct effect of stimulation on the sensory-motor subthalamic territory, while improvement in dyskinesias is mainly explained by an indirect effect related to the decrease in dopaminergic drugs. Our data suggest that non-motor fluctuations could similarly be directly alleviated through stimulation of the non-motor subthalamic territories, and hyperdopaminergic side effects might improve mainly due to the decrease in dopaminergic medication. We show an overall improvement in neuropsychiatric symptomatology and propose that disabling non-motor fluctuations, dopaminergic treatment abuse and drug-induced behavioural addictions in Parkinson's disease may be considered as new indications for subthalamic stimulation. © 2012 The Author.",Brain,May-12

reward","The successful pharmacotherapy for drug addiction is a challenge for pharmacology in XXI century. We still do not have any registered medication for cocaine by FDA, alcohol therapies are not enough successful. High hopes concern metabotropic glutamate 7 receptor as a target for pharmacotherapy development of drug dependence. It is well documented the role of the mGluR7 in rewarding and motivational effects of cocaine and alcohol. The mGluR7 allosteric agonist AMN082 and antagonist MMPIP have become new tools in preclinical studies. AMN082 attenuated cocaine-enhanced electrical Brain Stimulation Reward (eBSR) in rats and decreased cocaine self-administration too, probably by counteracting cocaine-induced inhibition of the ventral pallidal GABA release. The mGluR7 activation reduced alcohol intake and preference in rats. The mGluR7 receptors take part in reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior after abstinence. The investigations showed that AMN082 suppressed cocaine-induced reinstatement of self-administrated rats via mGluR2/3 mechanism. It was mentioned also that mGluR7 allosteric agonist inhibited reinstatement of ethanol-induced CPP. Moreover, activation of the mGluR7 receptor exhibits less adverse reaction in comparison to other mGluRs and may give a promise for further development of drug dependence therapies in humans. However, some nonspecific effects of the mGluR7 in ethanol addiction have been recognized, so there are further investigations needed to explain the mechanisms of the mGluR7 action in rewarding and motivational effects of drugs. © 2012 Curr.

However, no neuroimaging studies to date have examined reward circuitry during the anticipation phase of reward in PG compared with in OCD while considering repetitive gambling and compulsion as addictive behaviors. Methods/Principal Findings: To elucidate the neural activities specific to the anticipation phase of reward, we performed event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in young adults with PG and compared them with those in patients with OCD and healthy controls. Fifteen male patients with PG, 13 patients with OCD, and 15 healthy controls, group-matched for age, gender, and IQ, participated in a monetary incentive delay task during fMRI scanning. Neural activation in the ventromedial caudate nucleus during anticipation of both gain and loss decreased in patients with PG compared with that in patients with OCD and healthy controls. Additionally, reduced activation in the anterior insula during anticipation of loss was observed in patients with PG compared with that in patients with OCD which was intermediate between that in OCD and healthy controls (healthy controls < PG < OCD), and a significant positive correlation between activity in the anterior insula and South Oaks Gambling Screen score was found in patients with PG. Conclusion(s): Decreased neural activity in the ventromedial caudate nucleus during anticipation may be a specific neurobiological feature for the pathophysiology of PG, distinguishing it from OCD and healthy controls. Correlation of anterior insular activity during loss anticipation with PG symptoms suggests that patients with PG fit the features of OCD associated with harm avoidance as PG symptoms deteriorate. Our findings have identified functional disparities and similarities between patients with PG and OCD related to the neural responses associated with reward anticipation. © 2012 Choi et al.",PLoS ONE,20-Sep-12

Recent Findings: Transcranial direct current stimulation is a comparatively simple procedure. The available results warrant optimism regarding the future of this therapeutic approach in psychiatry. Multicentre studies of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation demonstrate a moderate treatment effect in depression. Theta burst stimulation and deep brain repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation represent innovative promising developments. The invasiveness of deep brain stimulation still causes this method to be one of the last resorts, even though promising results in severely disordered patients have been published. Summary: In our view, the field of brain stimulation will be rapidly moving forward in the near future and will establish itself as one more of the 'tools of the trade' in psychiatric therapeutic practice. © 2012 Wolters Kluwer Health  Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Current Opinion in Psychiatry,Nov-12

ventral tegmentum","Introduction: In Parkinson's disease, the degeneration of the dopaminergic system and the longstanding exposure to dopamine replacement therapy (DRT) may cause, in a group of vulnerable patients, dysregulation of the brain reward system. State of the arts: These patients develop DRT-related compulsions, which include addiction to levodopa or dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS), punding, and impulse control disorders (ICDs). ICDs or behavioral addiction reported in Parkinson's disease include pathological gambling, hypersexuality, compulsive buying and binge eating. Although the underlying pathophysiology is still poorly understood, these behaviors are linked by their reward-based and repetitive nature. Such behaviors may result in devastating psychosocial impairment for the patients and are often hidden. Perspective and conclusions: The recognition of these behaviors is important and allows a better clinical management. Although the limited data do not permit particular therapeutic strategies, some approaches are worth considering: DRT reduction, trials of non-dopaminergic medications and subthalamic chronic stimulation. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.",Revue Neurologique,August-September 2012

surgical technique","Since the beginning of recorded history, humans have sought a physical means of altering disordered behavior and consciousness. This quest has spawned numerous innovations in neurosurgery and the neurosciences, from the earliest prehistoric attempts at trepanation to the electrocortical and anatomic localization of cerebral function that emerged in the 19th century. At the start of the 20th century, the overwhelming social impact of psychiatric illness intersected with the novel but imperfect understanding of frontal lobe function, establishing a decades-long venture into the modern origin of psychosurgery, the prefrontal lobotomy. The subsequent social and ethical ramifications of the widespread overuse of transorbital lobotomies drove psychosurgery to near extinction. However, as the pharmacologic treatment of psychiatric illness was established, numerous concomitant technical and neuroscientific innovations permitted the incremental development of a new paradigm of treating the disordered mind. In this article, we retrospectively examine these early origins of psychosurgery and then look to the recent past, present, and future for emerging trends in surgery of the psyche. Recent decades have seen a revolution in minimalism, noninvasive imaging, and functional manipulation of the human cerebrum that have created new opportunities and treatment modalities for disorders of the human mind and mood. Early contemporary efforts were directed at focal lesioning of abnormal pathways, but deep-brain stimulation now aims to reversibly alter and modulate those neurologic activities responsible for not only psychiatric disorders, but also to modulate and even to augment consciousness, memory, and other elements of cerebral function. As new tools become available, the social and medical impact of psychosurgery promises to revolutionize not only neurosurgery, but also humans' capability for positively impacting life and society. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

weight reduction","Enterally administered levodopa/carbidopa gel (Duodopa) is used for the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) in patients with motor fluctuations and dyskinesias. This review summarizes the current efficacy and safety data on this drug. Clinically important differences (CID) have been used to assess whether statistical improvements in symptoms translate into meaningful improvements for the patients.A PubMed search in February 2012 found 23 papers with efficacy data and 33 with safety data. Of 11 studies reporting Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) III scores, 10 found improvements that met the CID of 10.8 points. Of 7 studies reporting UPDRS IV scores, 5 found improvements meeting the CID of 2.3 points. Quality of life (QoL) was assessed in 6 studies using the 8- or 39-question version of the Parkinson's disease Questionnaire, and all reported improvements meeting the CID (10 points). Due to the nature of the data, it is not possible to give exact numbers for the frequency of adverse events. However, the findings seem to be in line with a previous report stating the majority of adverse events were related to the infusion system or surgical procedure rather than the drug. In conclusion, the large majority of studies have reported that Duodopa is clinically effective in relieving the symptoms of advanced PD and improving QoL in comparison with conventional therapy. High-quality randomized trials with larger patient numbers will yield greater insights into the efficacy and safety of this treatment. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Parkinsonism and Related Disorders,Sep-12

*temporal lobe epilepsy","Historically, deja vu has been linked to seizure activity in temporal lobe epilepsy, and clinical reports suggest that many patients experience the phenomenon as a manifestation of simple partial seizures. We review studies on deja vu in epilepsy with reference to recent advances in the understanding of deja vu from a cognitive and neuropsychological standpoint. We propose a decoupled familiarity hypothesis, whereby deja vu is produced by an erroneous feeling of familiarity which is not in keeping with current cognitive processing. Our hypothesis converges on a parahippocampal dysfunction as the locus of deja vu experiences. However, several other temporal lobe structures feature in reports of deja vu in epilepsy. We suggest that some of the inconsistency in the literature derives from a poor classification of the various types of deja experiences. We propose deja vu/deja vecu as one way of understanding deja experiences more fully. This distinction is based on current models of memory function, where deja vu is caused by erroneous familiarity and deja vecu by erroneous recollection. Priorities for future research and clinical issues are discussed. Copyright © 2012 Nathan A. Illman et al.",Epilepsy Research and Treatment,2012

Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale","Objective: Characterize potential risk factors and the relationship of dopamine agonist (DA) withdrawal syndrome (DAWS), dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS), and impulse control disorders (ICDs) in Parkinson's disease (PD). Method(s): A retrospective chart review categorized cases into three groups: DAWS, DDS, and ICDs. Result(s): A total of 1,040 subjects met inclusion criteria. There were 332 subjects with a history of tapering DAs and 26 (7.8%) developed DAWS. Fourteen (1.3%) and 89 (8.6%) met the criteria for both DDS and ICD. Subjects with DAWS, DDS, and ICDs had a higher baseline dose of DA, levodopa, and total dopaminergic medication (p < .05), compared to those without the three conditions. DDS was found to be related to the DAWS group (p < .001). When comparing to the PD population without DDS, younger age at onset of PD (p = .027), presence of DAWS (p < .001), ICDs (p = .003), and punding (p = .042) were all correlated with the DDS group, while male sex (p = .045), younger age at onset of PD (p < .001), presence of DAWS (p < .001), and presence of DDS (p = .001) and punding (p < .001) were related to the ICD group. Conclusion(s): There was a strong relationship between DAWS, DDS, and ICD in this large PD cohort. Dopaminergic therapy in a subset of PD patients was strongly associated with addiction-like behavioral issues. © 2011 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.",International Journal of Neuroscience,Mar-12

It is also notoriously difficult to treat. Prior attempts at pharmacological or neurological modulation, including deep brain stimulation, have primarily targeted homeostatic mechanisms of weight control centered in the hypothalamus. To date, these attempts have had limited success. Multiple lines of independent data suggest that dysregulated reward circuitry in the brain underlies behaviors leading to obesity. Here, we review the existing data and related neurocircuitry, as well as the scope of obesity and currently available treatments. Finally, we suggest a neuromodulation strategy geared toward regulating these dysfunctional circuits, primarily by alteration of frontolimbic circuits.

unspecified side effect / side effect","Anxiety disorders represent the most prevalent psychiatric disorders. In addition, a considerable burden is associated with them, not only for individual sufferers, but also for the health care system. However, many patients who might benefit from treatment are not diagnosed or treated. This may partly be due to lack of awareness of the anxiety disorders by primary care practitioners and by the sufferers themselves. In addition, the stigma still associated with psychiatric disorders and lack of confidence in psychiatric treatments are factors leading to no/under recognition and treatment, or the use of unnecessary or inappropriate treatments. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of recommendations for the pharmacological treatment of two common anxiety disorders, in particular obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and panic disorder (PD). The first-line treatments of OCD include medium-high doses of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and clomipramine, a tricyclic (TCA) antidepressant with prevalent serotonergic activity. The recommended drugs for PD include SSRIs, TCAs and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs); in treatmentresistant cases, benzodiazepines like alprazolam may be used in patients with no history of addiction and tolerance. Other treatment options include irreversible and reversible monoamine-oxidase inhibitors, hydroxyzine, and others. Besides pharmacological treatments, some psychological strategies have been shown to be effective, in particular, cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) and other variants of behavior therapy that have been sufficiently investigated in controlled studies, and, therefore, will be reviewed herein. © 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.",Current Topics in Medicinal Chemistry,Feb-12

In this pilot functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study we assessed whether a prototype behavioral addiction, pathological gambling (PG), is likewise associated with an enhanced response to stress. Method(s): We induced stress by injecting yohimbine (0.2-0.3 mg/kg, IV), an alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist that elicits stress-like physiological and psychological effects in humans and in laboratory animals, to four subjects with PG and to five non-gamblers mentally healthy control subjects. Their fMRI brain responses were assessed along with subjective stress and gambling urges ratings. Result(s): Voxelwise analyses of data sets from individual subjects, utilizing generalized linear model approach, revealed significant left amygdala activation in response to yohimbine across all PG subjects. This amygdala effect was not observed in the five control individuals. Yohimbine elicited subjective stress ratings in both groups with greater (albeit not statically significantly) average response in the PG subjects. On the other hand, yohimbine did not induce urges to gamble. Conclusion(s): The present data support the hypothesis of brain sensitization to pharmacologically-induced stress in PG. © 2012 Elman et al.",PLoS ONE,02-Feb-12

self report","Antisocial traits are common among alcoholics- particularly in certain subtypes. Although people with antisocial tendencies show atypical brain activation in some emotion and reward paradigms, how the brain reward systems of heavy drinkers (HD) are influenced by antisocial traits remains unclear. We used subjects' preferred alcohol drink odors (AO), appetitive (ApCO) and non-appetitive (NApO) control odors in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to determine if reward system responses varied as a function of antisocial trait density (ASD). In this retrospective analysis, we examined 30 HD who had participated in imaging twice: once while exposed to clamped intravenous alcohol infusion targeted to 50. mg%, and once during placebo saline infusion. Under placebo, there were positive correlations between ASD and blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) activation in the [AO > ApCO] contrast in the left dorsal putamen, while negative correlations were present in medial orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the bilateral amygdala. A similar pattern was observed in the correlation with the [AO > NApO] contrast. This inverse relationship between ASD and activation in OFC and amygdala was specific to AO. However, negative correlations between ASD and the [ApCO > NApO] contrast were also present in the insula, putamen, and medial frontal cortex. These data suggest that frontal and limbic reward circuits of those with significant ASD are less responsive to reward cues in general, and particularly to alcohol cues in medial OFC and amygdala. These findings are broadly consistent with the reward deficiency syndrome hypothesis, although positive correlation in the striatum suggests regional variability. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",NeuroImage,Mar-12

traumatic brain injury / drug therapy / prevention","The hippocampus is particularly vulnerable to the neurotoxic effects of obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypoxic brain injury, obstructive sleep apnoea, bipolar disorder, clinical depression and head trauma. Patients with these conditions often have smaller hippocampi and experience a greater degree of cognitive decline than individuals without these comorbidities. Moreover, hippocampal atrophy is an established indicator for conversion from the normal ageing process to developing mild cognitive impairment and dementia. As such, an important aim is to ascertain which modifiable factors can have a positive effect on the size of the hippocampus throughout life. Observational studies and preliminary clinical trials have raised the possibility that physical exercise, cognitive stimulation and treatment of general medical conditions can reverse age-related atrophy in the hippocampus, or even expand its size. An emerging concept - the dynamic polygon hypothesis - suggests that treatment of modifiable risk factors can increase the volume or prevent atrophy of the hippocampus. According to this hypothesis, a multidisciplinary approach, which involves strategies to both reduce neurotoxicity and increase neurogenesis, is likely to be successful in delaying the onset of cognitive impairment with ageing. Further research on the constellation of interventions that could be most effective is needed before recommendations can be made for implementing preventive and therapeutic strategies. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

subthalamic nucleus","Dopamine dysregulation syndrome is a complication of the dopaminergic treatment for Parkinson's disease, probably related to sensitization of the mesolimbic dopamine system. The relationship between dopamine dysregulation syndrome and deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus remains unclear. We report three patients with Parkinson's disease who developed de novo dopamine dysregulation syndrome after deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus. We hypothesized that the combined effect of dopaminergic replacement therapy and deep brain stimulation on the limbic territory of the subthalamic nucleus could have precipitated the dopamine dysregulation syndrome in these patients, by inducing hyperstimulation of the mesolimbic dopamine system. The outcome of postoperative dopamine dysregulation syndrome is poor despite deep brain stimulation adjustments, attempts to reduce the dose of dopaminergic drugs and the addition of quetiapine or antidepressants. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Journal of the Neurological Sciences,15-Jan-12

white matter","White matter dementia (WMD) is a syndrome introduced in 1988 to highlight the potential of cerebral white matter disorders to produce cognitive loss of sufficient severity to qualify as dementia. Neurologists have long understood that such a syndrome can occur, but the dominance of gray matter as the locus of higher function has strongly directed neurobehavioral inquiry to the cerebral cortex while white matter has received less attention. Contemporary neuroimaging has been crucial in enabling the recognition of white matter abnormalities in a host of disorders, and the correlation of these changes with cognitive performance. Comprising about half the brain, white matter is prominently or exclusively involved in well over 100 disorders, in each of which white matter dysfunction can potentially cause or contribute to dementia. Neuropsychological findings from ten categories of white matter disorder lead to a convergence of findings that document remarkable neurobehavioral commonality among the dementias produced. More recently, the syndrome of mild cognitive dysfunction (MCD) has been introduced to expand the concept of WMD by proposing a precursor syndrome related to early white matter neuropathology. WMD and MCD inform the understanding of how white matter contributes to normal and abnormal cognition, and the specific neuroanatomic focus of these syndromes may enhance the diagnosis and treatment of many disabling disorders that do not primarily implicate the cerebral cortex. Forming essential connections within widely distributed neural networks, white matter is critical for rapid and efficient information transfer that complements the information processing of gray matter. As neuroimaging continues to advance, further information on white matter structure can be expected, and behavioral neurology will play a central role in elucidating the functional significance of these emerging data. By emphasizing the contribution of myelinated systems to higher function, the study of white matter and cognition represents investigation of the basic neuroscience of human behavior. © 2012 The Author(s).",Therapeutic Advances in Neurological Disorders,Sep-12

review","Deep brain stimulation (DBS) involves the delivery of precise electrical signals to specific deep anatomical structures of the central nervous system, with the objective of altering or modulating neural functioning and achieving a reversible, adjustable and therapeutic or clinically beneficial effect. The exact mechanism of action of DBS is still the subject of ongoing investigations. However, based on extensive clinical investigations, it has become an established modality for the surgical treatment of advanced and medication intractable movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, essential tremor and dystonia. DBS is also being investigated for conditions such as intractable epilepsy, neurobehavioral and psychiatric disorders such as treatment resistant depression, obsessive compulsive disorders, addiction, obesity, Alzheimer's disease and traumatic brain injury. The advantage of DBS over older deep brain lesioning procedures is its reversibility and adjustability. The design of the DBS systems allows for dynamic adjustment of the effects of electrical stimulation by altering the contacts at which electrical pulses are delivered to the brain and changing the stimulation parameters of those pulses. The clinical results from studies on DBS show that it has great potential making it one of most promising fields which could be used to address challenging neurological problems.",IEEE reviews in biomedical engineering,2012

If biological intervention is required, psychopharmacological therapy is relatively safe and effective even in the presence of co-occurring medical conditions. Patients usually respond to treatment, although this may take longer than it does in younger adults and it may require the combination of biological with psychological treatment, and social and spiritual interventions. Effective treatment of depression in the elderly decreases both morbidity and mortality; it also may lead to reduced demands on family members and on health care and social services.",Consultant,Apr-12

DBS has drawn more and more attention because of its good curative effect, high safety and less side effect. Compared with surgery and other methods using electrical stimulation, DBS has the advantage of clear targets, high selectivity, adjustability, reversibility, non-destruction and high safety. However, there are only a few reports about DBS for the treatment of addiction at home and abroad. Efficacy of DBS is largely dependent on the correlation of the disease and stimulate targets. Without DBS of the disease-related targets, it is impossible to achieve satisfactory therapeutic effect. Despite the recent research in both animals and humans has indicated that DBS may be an effective intervention for patients with treatment-refractory addiction, it is not yet entirely clear which brain areas should be targeted. Therefore, in this review, the major brain areas targeted these years are summarized. But the precise mechanisms behind DBS remain unclear and continue to be explored.",Chinese Journal of Pharmacology and Toxicology,Jun-12

Epilepsy may be genetic or have a structural or metabolic cause (identified or unknown). The most common differential diagnoses are syncope and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. Seizures may be generalized or focal, and take different forms. All patients developing seizures should have an ECG, and neuroimaging should be undertaken in all patients developing epilepsy in whom a focal cause is suspected, with the exception of genetic focal epilepsies. Antiepileptic medication should be tailored to the specific needs of the patient, with particular reference to the seizure type(s) and epilepsy syndrome. Other needs, such as the likelihood of pregnancy, and the presence of co-morbidities including learning disability and psychiatric disorders also need to be taken into account. Patients not responding to antiepileptic drugs may be candidates for surgery. The need for ongoing medication should be regularly reviewed in patients in long-term remission. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",Medicine (United Kingdom),Sep-12

Psychotropic drugs enabled psychotherapy to become easier available for patients with symptoms which had interfered with open verbal communication. The research of the mechanisms of action of psychotropic drugs opened the way to investigate the brain functions and cohtributed to the progress of neuroscience. In the last years the development of qualitatively new psychotropics slowed down. A progeress can be expected especially in the introduction of biological methods of the treatment of drug dependence and in combining drug treatment with new physical methods, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) or deep brain stimulation (DBS). These methods differ substantially from electroconvulsive treatment. The patient remains conscious, he remains in verbal contact with the physician and their application is not disagreeable.",Klinicka Farmakologie a Farmacie,2012

withdrawal syndrome","The development of Impulse Control Disorders (ICDs) in Parkinson's disease (PD) is a recognised iatrogenic complication associated with the use of dopamine agonists. The prevalence of ICDs has been reported to be as high as 14% in studies conducted in Europe and North America. Early case reports and recent large-scale studies have shown that clinical features associated with the development of PD-related ICDs include novelty-seeking personality traits, early onset PD and a past history of psychiatric conditions. More recent studies have also suggested that ICDs may be associated with deep brain stimulation and dyskinesias. Moreover, there is heterogeneity in the clinical features associated with the range of ICDs, with studies pointing out that compulsive sexual behaviours and binge eating have fewer clinical features in common than compulsive buying and pathological gambling. The recent increase in the number of functional neuroimaging studies on patients with PD and ICDs, particularly those with pathological gambling, has provided a unique opportunity to understand the neurobiology of the disorder, and has indicated an abnormality in the meso-limbic dopaminergic pathways. Further studies directly comparing ICD sufferers with and without PD will provide valuable knowledge to aid in the management of both patient groups. This review will provide a clinical overview of impulse control behaviours in PD, including both commonly reported ICDs and other related impulsive-compulsive behaviours observed in PD. © 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.",Current Psychiatry Reviews,Aug-12

tremor / therapy","Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been proposed as a potential treatment of drug addiction on the basis of its effects on drug self-administration in animals and on addictive behaviours in some humans treated with DBS for other psychiatric or neurological conditions. DBS is seen as a more reversible intervention than ablative neurosurgery but it is nonetheless a treatment that carries significant risks. A review of preclinical and clinical evidence for the use of DBS to treat addiction suggests that more animal research is required to establish the safety and efficacy of the technology and to identify optimal treatment parameters before investigating its use in addicted persons. Severely addicted persons who try and fail to achieve abstinence may, however, be desperate enough to undergo such an invasive treatment if they believe that it will cure their addiction. History shows that the desperation for a ""cure"" of addiction can lead to the use of risky medical procedures before they have been rigorously tested. In the event that DBS is used in the treatment of addiction, we provide minimum ethical requirements for clinical trials of its use in the treatment of addiction. These include: restrictions of trials to severely intractable cases of addiction; independent oversight to ensure that patients have the capacity to consent and give that consent on the basis of a realistic appreciation of the potential benefits and risks of DBS; and rigorous assessments of the effectiveness and safety of this treatment compared to the best available treatments for addiction. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Neuroethics,Jul-11

withdrawal syndrome","The endogenous cannabinoid system is an important regulatory system involved in physiological homeostasis. Endocannabinoid signaling is known to modulate neural development, immune function, metabolism, synaptic plasticity and emotional state. Accumulating evidence also implicates brain endocannabinoid signaling in the etiology of drug addiction which is characterized by compulsive drug seeking, loss of control in limiting drug intake, emergence of a negative emotional state in the absence of drug use and a persistent vulnerability toward relapse to drug use during protracted abstinence. In this review we discuss the effects of drug intake on brain endocannabinoid signaling, evidence implicating the endocannabinoid system in the motivation for drug consumption, and drug-induced alterations in endocannabinoid function that may contribute to various aspects of addiction including dysregulated synaptic plasticity, increased stress responsivity, negative affective states, drug craving and relapse to drug taking. Current knowledge of genetic variants in endocannabinoid signaling associated with addiction is also discussed. © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Pharmacology and Therapeutics,Dec-11

sudden death","A range of implantable brain-interfacing devices (IBIDs) is currently in use and development for the treatment of movement disorders and disorders of mood, behaviour and thought. These include cochlear implants, deep brain stimulation (DBS), prosthetic limbs, and optogenetic interventions (the combined use of genetics and optics to control individual cells). While implantable non-brain devices, such as implantable cardioverter defibrillators, began receiving US Food and Drug Administration approval in 1980, the development of IBIDs is recent, with the approval of DBS for Parkinson's disease in 1997. The expansion in use of IBIDs from neurological to psychiatric conditions is even more recent, with current trials underway for a range of disorders including depression, OCD, addiction, Alzheimer's disease and Tourette's syndrome. Emerging applications of existing IBIDs and new devices in development differ from currently approved devices and applications in two potentially crucial ways: 1) They target conditions traditionally seen as psychiatric; and/or 2) They target and modify functions or traits tied closely to agency, personal identity and personhood. As such, understanding patients' and caregivers' conceptions of personal identity in the context of disease and treatment is important not only for the informed consent process, but also for questions of public policy. © 2011 Institute of Psychiatry.",International Review of Psychiatry,Oct-11

Prospective studies examining relapse risk are reviewed, and clinical, biological, and neural factors that predict relapse risk are identified. Clinical factors, patient-related factors, and subjective and behavioral measures such as depressive symptoms, stress, and drug craving all predict future relapse risk. Among biological measures, endocrine measures such as cortisol and cortisol/corticotropin (ACTH) ratio as a measure of adrenal sensitivity and serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor were also predictive of future relapse risk. Among neural measures, brain atrophy in the medial frontal regions and hyperreactivity of the anterior cingulate during withdrawal were identified as important in drug withdrawal and relapse risk. Caveats pertaining to specific drug abuse type and phase of addiction are discussed. Finally, significant implications of these findings for clinical practice are presented, with a specific focus on determining biological markers of relapse risk that may be used to identify those individuals who are most at risk of relapse in the clinic. Such markers may then be used to assess treatment response and develop specific treatments that will normalize these neural and biological sequelae so as to significantly improve relapse outcomes. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.",Current Psychiatry Reports,Oct-11

Drawing from work in behavioral economics and developments in the new field of neuroeconomics, we describe addiction as pathological patterns of responding resulting from the persistently high valuation of a reinforcer and/or an excessive preference for the immediate consumption of that reinforcer. We further suggest that, as indicated by the competing neurobehavioral decision systems theory, these patterns of pathological choice and consumption result from an imbalance between two distinct neurobehavioral systems. Specifically, pathological patterns of responding result from hyperactivity in the evolutionarily older impulsive system (which values immediate and low-cost reinforcers) and/or hypoactivity in the more recently evolved executive system (which is involved in the valuation of delayed reinforcers). This approach is then used to explain five phenomena that we believe any adequate theory of addiction must address. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.",Current Psychiatry Reports,Oct-11

traumatic brain injury","Adenosine is a neuromodulator with several functions in the central nervous system (CNS), such as inhibition of neuronal activity in many signaling pathways. Most of the sedating, anxiolytic, seizure-inhibiting and protective actions of adenosine are mediated by adenosine A1 receptors (A1R) on the surface of neurons and glia. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a powerful in vivo imaging tool which can be applied to investigate the physiologic and pathologic roles of A1R in the human brain, and to elucidate the mechanism of action of therapeutic drugs targeting adenosine receptors, nucleoside transporters and adenosine-degrading enzymes. In this review article, we discuss (i) functions of adenosine and its receptors in cerebral metabolism; (ii) radioligands for A1R imaging: xanthine antagonists, non-xanthine antagonists, and agonists; (iii) roles of A1R in health and disease, viz. sleep-wake regulation, modulation of memory retention and retrieval, mediating the effects of alcohol consumption, protecting neurons during ischemia and reperfusion, suppression of seizures, modulating neuroinflammation and limiting brain damage in neurodegenerative disorders. The application of PET imaging could lead to novel insights in these areas. Finally (iv), we discuss the application of PET in pharmacodynamic studies and we examine therapeutic applications of adenosine kinase inhibitors, e.g. in the treatment of pain, inflammation, and epilepsy. © 2011 Bentham Science Publishers.",Current Medicinal Chemistry,Nov-11

therapy effect","Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic psychiatric disorder that affects 2% of the general population. Despite optimal cognitive-behavioral and pharmacologic therapy, approximately 10% of patients remain treatment resistant. Currently, deep brain stimulation (DBS) is being investigated as an experimental therapy for treatment-refractory OCD. This review focuses on the efficacy and adverse events of all published DBS targets for OCD: anterior limb of the internal capsule, ventral striatum/ventral capsule, nucleus accumbens, nucleus subthalamicus, and inferior thalamic peduncle. Small studies with various designs indicate an overall average Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale score decrease ranging from 6.8 to 31 points. The average overall responder rate is +/-50%. The frequency of adverse events seems to be limited. Larger prospective studies including neuroimaging are needed to estimate adequately the true potential of DBS in treatment of OCD and to elucidate its underlying mechanism of action and optimal brain target. We conclude that DBS may be a promising and safe therapy for treatment-resistant OCD. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Current Psychiatry Reports,Aug-11

xerostomia / side effect","Essential tremor (ET) is one of the most common neurological disorders among adults, and is the most common tremor disorder. ET has classically been viewed as a benign monosymptomatic condition. Yet over the past 10 years, a growing body of evidence indicates that this is a progressive condition that is clinically heterogeneous, and may be associated with a variety of different features such as gait abnormalities, parkinsonism, cognitive impairment, dementia, personality disturbances, depressive symptoms, and sensory abnormalities (e.g., mild olfactory dysfunction and hearing impairment). In addition, postmortem studies are showing a pathologically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disease. The emerging view is that ET might be a family of diseases, unified by the presence of kinetic tremor, but further characterized by etiological, clinical and pathological heterogeneity. The diagnosis of ET is clinical and made by history and physical examination. Effective pharmacological treatments for the disorder currently remain limited. Drugs are generally initiated when the tremor begins to interfere with the patient's ability to perform daily activities or when the tremor becomes embarrassing. For severe, medically refractory ET, thalamic ventralis intermedius nucleus deep brain stimulation may lessen tremor and improve function.",Minerva Medica,Dec-11

We examined the effect of monetary incentive on response inhibition among adolescents with and without substance use disorder (SUD) using a fast event-related fMRI antisaccade reward task. The fMRI task permits investigation of how reward (monetary incentive) might modulate inhibitory control during three task phases: cue presentation (reward or neutral trial), response preparation, and response execution. Adolescents with lifetime SUD (n=12; 100% marijuana use disorder) were gender and age-matched to healthy controls (n=12). Monetary incentive facilitated inhibitory control for SUD adolescents; for healthy controls, the difference in error rate for neutral and reward trials was not significant. There were no significant differences in behavioral performance between groups across reward and neutral trials, however, group differences in regional brain activation were identified. During the response preparation phase of reward trials, SUD adolescents, compared to controls, showed increased activation of prefrontal and oculomotor control (e.g., frontal eye field) areas, brain regions that have been associated with effective response inhibition. Results indicate differences in brain activation between SUD and control youth when preparing to inhibit a prepotent response in the context of reward, and support a possible role for incentives in enhancing response inhibition among youth with SUD. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Drug and Alcohol Dependence,01-May-11

ventral tegmentum","Dopamine (DA) transmission is deeply affected by drugs of abuse, and alterations in DA function are involved in the various phases of drug addiction and potentially exploitable therapeutically. In particular, basic studies have documented a reduction in the electrophysiological activity of DA neurons in alcohol, opiate, cannabinoid, and other drugdependent rats. Further, DA release in the Nucleus accumbens (Nacc) is decreased in virtually all drug-dependent rodents. In parallel, these studies are supported by increments in intracranial self stimulation (ICSS) thresholds during withdrawal from alcohol, nicotine, opiates, and other drugs of abuse, thereby suggesting a hypofunction of the neural substrate of ICSS. Accordingly, morphological evaluations fed into realistic computational analysis of the medium spiny neuron of the Nacc, postsynaptic counterpart of DA terminals, show profound changes in structure and function of the entire mesolimbic system. In line with these findings, human imaging studies have shown a reduction of dopamine receptors accompanied by a lesser release of endogenous DA in the ventral striatum of cocaine, heroin, and alcohol-dependent subjects, thereby offering visual proof of the ""dopamine-impoverished"" addicted human brain. The lasting reduction in physiological activity of the DA system leads to the idea that an increment in its activity, to restore predrug levels, may yield significant clinical improvements (reduction of craving, relapse, and drug-seeking/taking). In theory, it may be achieved pharmacologically and/or with novel interventions such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Its anatomo-physiological rationale as a possible therapeutic aid in alcoholics and other addicts will be described and proposed as a theoretical framework to be subjected to experimental testing in human addicts. © 2011 Diana.",Frontiers in Psychiatry,2011

Although some initial case reports claimed that dopamine replacement therapies, particularly dopamine agonists, cause ICDs, more recent, larger and better controlled studies indicate a more complicated picture. While dopamine replacement therapy use is related to ICDs, other vulnerabilities, some related to PD and/or its treatment directly and others seemingly unrelated to PD, have also been associated with ICDs in PD. This suggests a complex etiology with multiple contributing factors. As ICDs occur in a sizable minority of PD patients and can be associated with significant distress and impairment, further investigation is needed to identify factors that can predict who may be more likely to develop ICDs. Clinical implications are discussed and topics for future research are offered. © 2011 Future Medicine Ltd.",Neuropsychiatry,Apr-11

tremor","Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has developed during the past 20 years as a remarkable treatment option for several different disorders. Advances in technology and surgical techniques have essentially replaced ablative procedures for most of these conditions. Stimulation of the ventralis intermedius nucleus of the thalamus has clearly been shown to markedly improve tremor control in patients with essential tremor and tremor related to Parkinson disease. Symptoms of bradykinesia, tremor, gait disturbance, and rigidity can be significantly improved in patients with Parkinson disease. Because of these improvements, a decrease in medication can be instrumental in reducing the disabling features of dyskinesias in such patients. Primary dystonia has been shown to respond well to DBS of the globus pallidus internus. The success of these procedures has led to application of these techniques to multiple other debilitating conditions such as neuropsychiatric disorders, intractable pain, epilepsy, camptocormia, headache, restless legs syndrome, and Alzheimer disease. The literature analysis was performed using a MEDLINE search from 1980 through 2010 with the term deep brain stimulation, and several double-blind and larger case series were chosen for inclusion in this review. The exact mechanism of DBS is not fully understood. This review summarizes many of the current and potential future clinical applications of this technology. © 2011 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.",Mayo Clinic Proceedings,Jul-11

withdrawal syndrome","Drug addiction is a syndrome of impaired response inhibition and salience attribution, which involves a complex neurocircuitry underlying drug reinforcement, drug craving, and compulsive drug-seeking and drug-taking behaviors despite adverse consequences. The concept of disease stages with transitions from acute rewarding effects to early- and end-stage addiction has had an important impact on the design of nonclinical animal models. This chapter reviews the main advances in nonclinical paradigms that aim to at model (1) positive and negative reinforcing effects of addictive drugs; (2) relapse to drug-seeking behavior; (3) reconsolidation of drug cue memories, and (4) compulsive/impulsive drug intake. In addition, recent small animal neuroimaging studies and invertebrate models will be briefly discussed (see also Bifone and Gozzi, Animal models of ADHD, 2011). Continuous improvement in modeling drug intake, craving, withdrawal symptoms, relapse, and comorbid psychiatric associations is a necessary step to better understand the etiology of the disease and to ultimately foster the discovery, validation and optimization of new efficacious pharmacotherapeutic approaches. The modeling of specific subprocesses or constructs that address clinically defined criteria will ultimately increase our understanding of the disease as a whole. Future research will have to address the questions of whether some of these constructs can be reliably used as outcome measures to assess the effects of a treatment in clinical settings, whether changes in those measures can be a target of therapeutic efforts, and whether they relate to biological markers of traits such as impulsivity, which contribute to increased drug-seeking and may predict binge-like patterns of drug intake. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.",,2011

The involvement of the STN in cognitive and motivational processes has been demonstrated since, and psychiatrists are now considering this small structure as a possible target for the treatment of various disorders. In this review, we will address six questions to highlight (1) How increased knowledge has led us from a strictly motor model to an integrative one. (2) How knowledge acquired in animal models can be similar or (3) different from the effects observed in human patients. (4) How clinical trials are sometimes ahead of fundamental research carried out in animals, showing effects that could not be predicted on the basis of animal studies, thus questioning the relevance of some animal models, especially for psychiatric disorders. We will also address the possible future orientations (5) and how the use, or precaution not to use, certain key words in animal research dedicated to STN functions can lead to the omission of a certain amount of available data in the literature (6).This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Function and Dysfunction of the Basal Ganglia. © 2011 IBRO.",Neuroscience,15-Dec-11

However, there is an ever increasing awareness that there are also many non-motor phenomena associated with PD. In this review, we aim to explore impulse control disorders (ICDs) in PD, outlining their aetiology and clinical features and providing an overview of their diagnosis and management. ICDs in PD (compulsive gambling, punding, hypersexuality, walkabout and the dopamine dysregulation syndrome) appear to be intricately linked to dopamine therapy and the mesolimbic system. They can be challenging to manage and may have devastating consequences for patients and their families. © 2011 Rila Publications Ltd.",CME Journal Geriatric Medicine,2011

Regarding non-smokers, results are inconsistent, and no data exist on the effect of nicotine on neural emotion processing. We applied functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess the influence of nicotine on brain activation during processing of emotional stimuli in 31 non-smokers with a maximum lifetime cigarette consumption of 20 cigarettes. Participants were subjected to two fMRI scans with event-related presentations of images taken from the International Affective Picture System, receiving nicotine (2 mg) and placebo gums in a double-blinded, randomized cross-over design. Furthermore, subjective affect was assessed. Nicotine increased brain activity in response to unpleasant stimuli in the amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and basal ganglia, whereas processing of pleasant stimuli was not altered. Psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses revealed that nicotine increased connectivity between the amygdala and the perigenual ACC (pACC) during processing of unpleasant stimuli and decreased connectivity between those structures during processing of pleasant stimuli. Participants reported higher state anxiety under nicotine than placebo. A single dose of nicotine acted as a stressor in non-smokers, leading to increased anxiety and neural activation elicited by unpleasant stimuli as well as altered connectivity within the amygdala-pACC circuit. Besides the possibility that reactions to nicotine may differ between non-smokers and smokers due to tolerance and neuroadaptive processes that occur during prolonged nicotine use, a priori differences in smokers and non-smokers might potentially explain diverse effects of nicotine on affect and emotional reactivity. © 2010 Society for the Study of Addiction.",Addiction Biology,Apr-11

Dysphoria and anxiety, hallucinations, apathy and cognitive impairment are the most common symptoms. The etiology is heterogeneous and includes psychosocial, structural and chemical brain changes, and treatment-related factors. Consensus criteria for the diagnoses of psychosis, depression and dementia associated with Parkinsons disease are now available, and a number of rating scales and questionnaires have been validated for the evaluation of cognitive impairment and psychiatric symptoms in Parkinsons disease. Level I evidence is available for the treatment of dementia, depression and psychosis, but there is still a need for development of safer and more effective treatments. © 2011 Future Medicine Ltd.",Aging Health,Feb-11

The first spectacular application has been developed for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. This development has been the result of interactions between clinical observations and studies carried out in animal models. Further investigations in animal models have lead to consider not only possible side effects of DBS on nonmotor functions in parkinsonian patients but also DBS as a possible strategy for other diseases, including psychiatric disorders such as obsessive compulsive disorder or addiction. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",,2011

However, with currently available interventions, a substantial number of patients experience incomplete resolution of symptoms, and relapse rates are high. In the search for better treatments, increasing interest has focused on focal neuromodulation. This focus has been driven by improved neuroanatomical models of mood, thought, and behavior regulation, as well as by more advanced strategies for directly and focally altering neural activity. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is one of the most invasive focal neuromodulation techniques available; data have supported its safety and efficacy in a number of movement disorders. Investigators have produced preliminary data on the safety and efficacy of DBS for several psychiatric disorders, as well. In this review, we describe the development and justification for testing DBS for various psychiatric disorders, carefully consider the available clinical data, and briefly discuss potential mechanisms of action. © 2011 by Annual Reviews.

We aimed to explore the electrophysiological changes in reward-related brain regions during NAc stimulation and reveal the effects of stimulation frequency and target changes on NAc neuronal activities. Material/Methods: Twenty-eight rats were randomized into saline (n=8) and morphine (n=20) groups. The morphine group was further divided into core (n=10, only the core of the NAc was stimulated) and shell (n=10, only the shell of the NAc was stimulated) subgroups. Conditioned place preference (CPP) behavior of the rats was evaluated to confirm morphine preference after morphine injection and CPP training for 10 days. We recorded NAc neuronal responses to NAc core stimulation at different frequencies, as well as changes in VP and VTA neuronal firing during NAc core stimulation, and changes in NAc neuronal firing during NAc shell stimulation. Result(s): The results indicate that high frequency stimulation was more effective in suppressing NAc neuronal activities than low frequency stimulation and that core stimulation was more effective than shell stimulation. Most VP neurons were inhibited by NAc core stimulation, while VTA neurons were not. Conclusion(s): The results suggest that electrical stimulation in the NAc can suppress neuronal firing in rewardrelated brain regions. The stimulation might be frequency- dependent in suppressing neuronal firing. The core and shell of the NAc play different roles in suppressing NAc neuronal firing as 2 stimulating targets. © Med Sci Monit, 2011.",Medical Science Monitor,2011

treatment response","Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can develop in some individuals who are exposed to an event that causes extreme fear, horror, or helplessness (APA, 1994). PTSD is a complex and heterogeneous disorder, which is often co-morbid with depression, substance abuse, and anxiety disorders such as panic or social phobia. Given this complexity, progress in the field can be greatly enhanced by focusing on phenotypes that are more proximal to the neurobiology of the disorder. Such neurobiological intermediate phenotypes can provide investigative tools to increase our understanding of the roots of the disorder and develop better prevention or intervention programs. In the present paper, we argue that the inhibition of fear responses is an intermediate phenotype that is related to both the neurocircuitry associated with the disorder, and is linked to its clinical symptoms. An advantage of focusing on fear inhibition is that the neurobiology of fear has been well investigated in animal models providing the necessary groundwork in understanding alterations. Furthermore, because many paradigms can be tested across species, fear inhibition is an ideal translational tool. Here we review both the behavioral tests and measures of fear inhibition and the related neurocircuitry in neuroimaging studies with both healthy and clinical samples. © 2011 Jovanovic and Norrholm.",Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience,Jul-11

subthalamic nucleus","Impulsive-compulsive behaviours (ICBs) are an increasingly well-recognised adverse-effect of dopaminergic medications used to treat Parkinson's disease. ICBs include pathological gambling, compulsive sexual behaviour, compulsive buying, and binge eating, together with punding and the addiction-like compulsive use of dopamine replacement therapy, or dopamine dysregulation syndrome. The prevalence of ICBs was approximately 14% in a large study undertaken in specialist movement disorder clinics. Dopamine dysregulation syndrome is more associated with compulsive l-dopa use, whereas other ICBs are more linked with oral dopamine agonist use. Other mechanisms implicated in the development and perpetuation of ICBs in PD include aberrant learning from reward-related situations, including decreased learning from negative feedback, increased measures of impulsivity or sensation seeking, and strong preference for immediate over future rewards. Treatment options for impulsive-compulsive behaviours include pharmacological, surgical and psychological interventions. The early recognition and prevention of ICBs, coupled with awareness of clinical risk factors for the development of these behaviours is of paramount importance, given the lack of specific treatments for these sometimes debilitating behaviours. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Journal of the Neurological Sciences,15-Nov-11

However, no comparisons of the prevalence of addictive behaviors in patients with Parkinson's disease and the general population have been published. The objective of this study was to compare the prevalence and characteristics of addictions (gambling, hypersexuality, tobacco, and alcohol) in patients with Parkinson's disease and in a matched, paired sample from the general population. Method(s):: After matching for age, sex, and complete field questionnaires on addictions, we had 115 data sets. Result(s): No difference was observed between Parkinson's disease and control populations concerning pathological gambling (0.87% vs 0.87%, P =.99), tobacco addiction (1.7% vs 1.7%, P =.99), and alcohol dependence (2.6% vs 3.5%, P =.71). The Parkinson's disease group showed 2 cases of sexual addiction (1.7% vs 0, P =.15). Conclusion(s): Our results indicate that patients with Parkinson's disease do not have specific profiles for tobacco or alcohol addiction and pathological gambling compared with the general population. © 2011 Movement Disorder Society.",Movement Disorders,Sep-11

Before and one year following the surgery, we assessed the effects of DBS within the NAc on the addiction as well as on psychometric scores and electrophysiological measures of cognitive control. In our patient, DBS achieved normalization of addictive behavior and craving. An electrophysiological marker of error processing (the error-related negativity) linked to anterior mid-cingulate cortex (aMCC) functioning was altered through DBS, an effect that could be reversed by periods without stimulation. Thus, this case supports the hypothesis that DBS of the NAc could have a positive effect on addiction trough a normalization of craving associated with aMCC dysfunction. © 2010 Society for the Study of Addiction.",Addiction Biology,Oct-11

Method(s): We used an incentive conflict task to investigate ability to abstain from responding during presentations of incentive cues. Both alcoholic (n = 23) and healthy subjects (n = 22) were required to withhold responding during the simultaneous presentation of two visual stimuli in which the individual presentation allowed responding for monetary reward. Brain structures activated during performance of the task were studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging in healthy volunteers (n = 8), and changes in gray matter volume were studied in a separate group of patients (n = 29) compared with control subjects (n = 31) in regions of interest identified on functional magnetic resonance imaging. Result(s): Abstinent alcoholic patients were severely impaired on the incentive conflict task. The impairment was greater in patients with experience of several versus a single detoxification. Healthy volunteers, during the same incentive conflict task, showed distinct patterns of brain activation (including gyrus rectus, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and superior frontal gyrus). Reduction of gray matter volume in ventromedial prefrontal cortex and superior frontal gyrus of patients was more extensive in those with multiple detoxifications. Conclusion(s): Performance deficits in alcoholics are associated with withdrawal-induced impairments in prefrontal subfields, which are exacerbated following repeated episodes of detoxification. Detoxification thus compromises functional and structural integrity of prefrontal cortex and may thus impair the ability to control future drinking. Performance in the incentive conflict task is a sensitive biomarker for such deficits. © 2011 Society of Biological Psychiatry.",Biological Psychiatry,15-Sep-11

Detoxified alcoholics show differences in regional brain activation during a monetary incentive delay task. However, there is limited information on whether this uncharacteristic behavior represents a biological predisposition toward alcohol abuse, a consequence of chronic alcohol use, or both. Method(s): We investigated proposed neural correlates of substance disorder risk by examining reward system activity during a monetary incentive delay task with separate reward prospect, reward anticipation, and reward outcome phases in 30 individuals with and 19 without family histories of alcoholism. All subjects were healthy, lacked DSM-IV past or current alcohol or substance abuse histories, and were free of illegal substances as verified by a urine toxicology screening at the time of scanning. Additionally, we explored specific correlations between task-related nucleus accumbens (NAcc) activation and distinct factor analysis-derived domains of behavioral impulsivity. Result(s): During reward anticipation, functional magnetic resonance imaging data confirmed blunted NAcc activation in family history positive subjects. In addition, we found atypical activation in additional reward-associated brain regions during additional task phases. We further found a significant negative correlation between NAcc activation during reward anticipation and an impulsivity construct. Conclusion(s): Overall, results demonstrate that sensitivity of the reward circuit, including NAcc, is functionally different in alcoholism family history positive individuals in multiple regards. © 2011 Society of Biological Psychiatry.",Biological Psychiatry,01-Apr-11

ventromedial prefrontal cortex","Neuroscience has increasingly explored the neural mechanisms underlying our sense of self. Recent studies have demonstrated the recruitment of regions like the ventral tegmental area, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and the ventral striatum to self-specific stimuliregions typically associated with reward-related processing. This raises the question of whether there is a relationship between self and reward and, if so, how these different fields can be linked. Three relationship models that aim to explore the relationship between self and reward are discussed here: integration, segregation, and parallel processing. Their pros and cons are reviewed in light of the most recent findings. The conclusion is that both the fields of self and reward may benefit from increased interaction. This interaction may help to fill in some of the missing pieces regarding reward-related processing, as well as illuminate how brain function can bring forward the philosophical concept and psychological reality of self. © 2011 Society of Biological Psychiatry.",Biological Psychiatry,01-Jun-11

risk assessment","Background: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is primarily conceived as an anxiety disorder but has features resembling addictive behavior. Patients with OCD may develop dependency upon compulsive behaviors because of the rewarding effects following reduction of obsession-induced anxiety. Reward processing is critically dependent on ventral striatal-orbitofrontal circuitry and brain imaging studies in OCD have consistently shown abnormal activation within this circuitry. This is the first functional imaging study to investigate explicitly reward circuitry in OCD. Method(s): Brain activity during reward anticipation and receipt was compared between 18 OCD patients and 19 healthy control subjects, using a monetary incentive delay task and functional magnetic resonance imaging. Reward processing was compared between OCD patients with predominantly contamination fear and patients with predominantly high-risk assessment. Result(s): Obsessive-compulsive disorder patients showed attenuated reward anticipation activity in the nucleus accumbens compared with healthy control subjects. Reduced activity of the nucleus accumbens was more pronounced in OCD patients with contamination fear than in patients with high-risk assessment. Brain activity during reward receipt was similar between patients and control subjects. A hint toward more dysfunctional reward processing was found in treatment-resistant OCD patients who subsequently were successfully treated with deep brain stimulation of the nucleus accumbens. Conclusion(s): Obsessive-compulsive disorder patients may be less able to make beneficial choices because of altered nucleus accumbens activation when anticipating rewards. This finding supports the conceptualization of OCD as a disorder of reward processing and behavioral addiction. © 2011 Society of Biological Psychiatry.",Biological Psychiatry,01-May-11

review","Deep brain stimulation has been put forward as a potential ""cure"" for intractable drug addiction. This is largely based on preclinical studies in animal models of addiction and small case series of positive, but short-term, effects on addictive behaviour in highly selected individuals. The history of neurosurgical treatment for psychiatric disorders suggests that we should be cautious in prematurely advocating invasive neurosurgical procedures on the basis of such limited evidence. Further research is required in animal models of addiction and in people treated for other neurological or psychiatric disorders before trials in addicted populations can be justified. © 2011 Faculty of 1000 Ltd.",F1000 Medicine Reports,03-Feb-11

substance abuse","Context: Research has implicated an addictive process in the development and maintenance of obesity. Although parallels in neural functioning between obesity and substance dependence have been found, to our knowledge, no studies have examined the neural correlates of addictive-like eating behavior. Objective(s): To test the hypothesis that elevated ""food addiction"" scores are associated with similar patterns of neural activation as substance dependence. Design(s): Between-subjects functional magnetic resonance imaging study. Setting(s): A university neuroimaging center. Participant(s): Forty-eight healthy young women ranging from lean to obese recruited for a healthy weight maintenance trial. Main Outcome Measure(s): The relation between elevated food addiction scores and blood oxygen level - dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging activation in response to receipt and anticipated receipt of palatable food (chocolate milkshake). Result(s): Food addiction scores (N=39) correlated with greater activation in the anterior cingulate cortex, medial orbitofrontal cortex, and amygdala in response to anticipated receipt of food (P<.05, false discovery rate corrected for multiple comparisons in small volumes). Participants with higher (n=15) vs lower (n=11) food addiction scores showed greater activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the caudate in response to anticipated receipt of food but less activation in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex in response to receipt of food (false discovery rate-corrected P<.05). Conclusion(s): Similar patterns of neural activation are implicated in addictive-like eating behavior and substance dependence: elevated activation in reward circuitry in response to food cues and reduced activation of inhibitory regions in response to food intake. ©2011 American Medical Association.

xerostomia / side effect","Tourette syndrome (TS) is a chronic neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by tics: repetitive, involuntary movements and vocalizations. These symptoms can have a significant impact on patients' daily functioning across many domains. Tics tend to be most severe in child and adolescent sufferers, so their presence has the potential to impact a period of life that is both critical for learning and is often associated with the experience of greater social tension and self-consciousness than adulthood. Furthermore, control over tics that lead to physical impairment or self-injurious behaviour is of vital importance in maintaining health and quality of life. There are numerous complicating factors in the prescription of treatment for tics, due to both the side effects associated with alleviating agents and patient characteristics, such as age and comorbid conditions. This review summarizes literature pertaining to the efficacy and safety of both traditionally prescribed and more modern medications. We also discuss the merits of behavioural and surgical techniques and highlight newer emerging treatments. Although treatment response is to some extent variable, there are a number of agents that are clearly useful as first-line treatments for TS. Other interventions may be of most benefit to patients exhibiting refractory tics or more specific symptom profiles. © The Author(s), 2011.",Therapeutic Advances in Neurological Disorders,Jan-11

In spite of medications, these disorders can result in progressive loss of function as well as chronic physical, cognitive, and emotional disability that ultimately places enormous emotional and economic on the patient, caretakers, and the society in general. Neuromodulation is emerging as a therapeutic option in these patients. Neuromodulation is a field, which involves implantable devices that allow for the reversible adjustable application of electrical, chemical, or biological agents to the central or peripheral nervous system with the objective of altering its functioning with the objective of achieving a therapeutic or clinically beneficial effect. It is a rapidly evolving field that brings together many different specialties in the fields of medicine, materials science, computer science and technology, biomedical, and neural engineering as well as the surgical or interventional specialties. It has multiple current and emerging indications, and an enormous potential for growth. The main challenges before it are in the need for effective collaboration between engineers, basic scientists, and clinicians to develop innovations that address specific problems resulting in new devices and clinical applications. © 2006 IEEE.",IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,Jul-11

xerostomia / side effect","The goal of any treatment plan for essential tremor (ET) is to provide clinical benefit while minimizing potential side effects, thereby improving functional abilityand enhancing overall quality of life. The initiation of specific pharmacologic therapies is based on an evaluation of any prior exposure to medications, contraindications, and the benefits and potential side effects associated with particular agents. Selected patients with medication-resistant ET may benefit from chemodenervation with localized injections of botulinum toxin; for patients with severe, disabling ET, medication-refractory tremor, or adverse effects to pharmacologic treatment, surgery may be considered.",Romanian Journal of Neurology/ Revista Romana de Neurologie,2009

Their treatment represents a great challenge for the national health systems. In this article, the diagnostic criteria of the following four frequently observed groups of psychiatric disorders are described and evidence-based treatment strategies are presented: anxiety disorders, alcohol addiction, unipolar major depression, and schizophrenia. For each of these groups of psychiatric disorders contemporary developments are outlined and possible future treatment options are discussed. Biological treatment interventions such as pharmacotherapy and brain stimulation are mentioned in detail. Besides the classic drugs, substances with a new mode of action are of growing importance. nder clinical investigation. In conclusion, for all mentioned psychiatric disorders interesting biologically based future treatment options emerged which may contribute to general treatment regimes after given proof of evidence. © Schattauer 2010.",Nervenheilkunde,2010

treatment withdrawal","Obsessive-compulsive disorder is a severe and disabling clinical condition that usually arises in late adolescence or early adulthood and, if left untreated, has a chronic course. Whether this disorder should be classified as an anxiety disorder or in a group of putative obsessive-compulsive-related disorders is still a matter of debate. Biological models of obsessive-compulsive disorder propose anomalies in the serotonin pathway and dysfunctional circuits in the orbito-striatal area and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Support for these models is mixed and they do not account for the symptomatic heterogeneity of the disorder. The cognitive-behavioural model of obsessive-compulsive disorder, which has some empirical support but does not fully explain the disorder, emphasises the importance of dysfunctional beliefs in individuals affected. Both biological and cognitive models have led to empirical treatments for the disorder-ie, serotonin-reuptake inhibitors and various forms of cognitive-behavioural therapy. New developments in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder involve medications that work in conjuction with cognitive-behavioural therapy, the most promising of which is D-cycloserine. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

withdrawal syndrome","The endogenous cannabinoid system is involved in numerous physiological and neuropsychological functions. Medications that target this system hold promise for the treatment of a wide variety of disorders. However, as reward is one of the most prominent of these functions, medications that activate this system must be evaluated for abuse potential. Meanwhile, cannabis is already being used chronically by millions of people, many of whom eventually seek treatment for cannabis dependence. Therefore, there is a need for procedures that can be used to: (i) better understand the mechanisms of cannabinoid reward; (ii) evaluate the abuse potential of new medications; and (iii) evaluate the effectiveness of medications developed for treating cannabis dependence. Animal models of cannabinoid reward provide a means of accomplishing these goals. In this review, we briefly describe and evaluate these models, their advantages and their shortcomings. Special emphasis is placed on intravenous cannabinoid self-administration in squirrel monkeys, a valid, reliable and flexible model that we have developed over the past decade. Although the conditions under which cannabinoid drugs have rewarding effects may be more restricted than with other drugs of abuse such as cocaine and heroin, work with these models indicates that cannabinoid reward involves similar brain mechanisms and produces the same kinds of reward-related behaviour. By continuing to use these animal models as tools in the development of new medications, it should be possible to take advantage of the potential benefits provided by the endocannabinoid system while minimizing its potential for harm. © 2010 The British Pharmacological Society No claim to original US government works All rights reserved.",British Journal of Pharmacology,Jun-10

surgical approach","The theoretical basis of some deep brain stimulation (DBS) trials undertaken in the early years was the phenomenon of ""brain stimulation reward (BSR),"" which was first identified in rats. The animals appeared to be rewarded by pleasure caused by the stimulation of certain brain regions (reward system), such as the septal area. Self-stimulation experiments, in which rats were allowed to stimulate their own brain by pressing a freely accessible lever, they quickly learned lever pressing and sometimes continued to stimulate until they exhausted themselves. BSR was also observed with DBS of the septal area in humans. DBS trials in later years were undertaken on other theoretical bases, but unexpected BSR was sometimes induced by stimulation of some areas, such as the locus coeruleus complex. When BSR was induced, the subjects experienced feelings that were described as ""cheerful"", ""alert"", ""good"", ""well-being"", ""comfort"", ""relaxation"", ""joy"", or ""satisfaction."" Since the DBS procedure is equivalent to a ""self-stimulation"" experiment, they could become ""addicted to the stimulation itself"" or ""compulsive about the stimulation,"" and stimulate themselves ""for the entire day,"" ""at maximum amplitude"" and, in some instances, ""into convulsions."" DBS of the reward system has recently been applied to alleviate anhedonia in patients with refractory major depression. Although this approach appears promising, there remains a difficult problem: who can adjust their feelings and reward-oriented behavior within the normal range? With a self-stimulation procedure, the BSR may become uncontrollable. To develop DBS to the level of a standard therapy for mental disorders, we need to discuss ""Who has the right to control the mental condition?"" and ""Who makes decisions"" on ""How much control is appropriate?"" in daily life.",Neurologia Medico-Chirurgica,2010

Recent studies have shown that some of these techniques induce significant neurophysiological and clinical effects. Although recent results are promising, there are several techniques that have been abandoned despite positive initial results. In this study, we performed a systematic review to identify NIBS methods with promising preliminary clinical results that were not fully developed and adopted into clinical practice, and discuss its clinical, research and device characteristics. We identified five devices (transmeatal cochlear laser stimulation, transcranial micropolarization, transcranial electrostimulation, cranial electric stimulation and stimulation with weak electromagnetic fields) and compared them with two established NIBS devices (transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation) and with well-known drugs used in neuropsychiatry (pramipexole and escitalopram) in order to understand the reasons why they failed to reach clinical practice and further steps of research development. Finally, we also discuss novel NIBS devices that have recently showed promising results: brain ultrasound and transcranial high-frequency random noise stimulation. Our results show that some of the reasons for the failure of NIBS devices with promising clinical findings are the difficulty to disseminate results, lack of controlled studies, duration of research development, mixed results and lack of standardization. © 2010 Expert Reviews Ltd.",Expert Review of Medical Devices,Jan-10

ventral tegmentum","The roles of the nigrostriatal pathway are far beyond the simple control of motor functions. The tonic release of dopamine in the dorsal and ventral striatum controls the choice of proper actions toward a given environmental situation. In the striatum, a specific action is triggered by a specific stimulus associated with it. When the subject faces a novel and salient stimulus, the phasic release of dopamine allows synaptic plasticity in the cortico-striatal synapses. Neurons of different regions of cortical areas make synapses that converge to the same medium spine neurons of the striatum. The convergent associations form functional units encoding body parts, objects, locations, and symbolic representations of the subject's world. Such units emerge in the striatum in a repetitive manner, like a mosaic of broken mirrors. The phasic release of dopamine allows the association of units to encode an action of the subject directed to an object or location with the outcome of this action. Reinforced stimulus-action-outcome associations will affect future decision making when the same stimulus (object, location, idea) is presented to the subject in the future. In the absence of a minimal amount of striatal dopamine, no action is initiated as seen in Parkinson's disease subjects. The abnormal and improper association of these units leads to the initiation of unpurposeful and sometimes repetitive actions, as those observed in dyskinetic patients. The association of an excessive reinforcement of some actions, like drug consumption, leads to drug addiction. Improper associations of ideas and unpleasant outcomes may be related to traumatic and depressive symptoms common in many diseases, including Parkinson's disease. The same can be said about the learning and memory impairments observed in demented and nondemented Parkinson's disease patients. © 2009 Springer-Verlag Vienna.",,2009

It focuses on the data (derived principally from studies with experimental animals) showing that nicotine, like other drugs of dependence, stimulates the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) neurones that project to the nucleus accumbens and that these effects play a pivotal role in the biology underlying nicotine dependence. The reinforcing or rewarding properties of nicotine are thought to be associated particularly with the increase in DA overflow evoked in the shell subdivision of the accumbens. However, behavioural studies suggest that these properties of nicotine in experimental animals do not seem to be sufficiently potent to explain the powerful addiction to tobacco experienced by most habitual smokers. This chapter also considers the biological mechanisms that mediate the effects of cues and stimuli associated with the presentation of nicotine, which are thought to contribute significantly to the powerful addictive properties of tobacco smoke. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.",,2009

withdrawal syndrome","Psychostimulant addiction often consists of periods of sustained drug abstinence disrupted by periods of relapse and renewed heavy drug use. Prevention of relapse remains the greatest challenge to the successful treatment of drug addiction. Drug-associated cues are a primary trigger for relapse, as they can elicit intense craving for the drug. These cues become associated with the drug reward through Pavlovian learning processes that develop over multiple drug-cue pairings. The amygdala (AMY) is critical for such drug-related learning. Intrinsic and extrinsic circuitry position the AMY to integrate cue and drug-related information and influence drug-seeking and drug-taking behaviors. Animal models of conditioned drug reward, drug use, and relapse have confirmed the necessary role of the AMY for drug conditioned cues to control motivated behavior. Neurons within the AMY are responsive to the primary effects of psychostimulants, and more critically, they also respond to the presentation of drug-associated cues. The mechanisms by which conditioned cues come to influence drug-seeking behavior likely involve long-term plasticity and neuroadaptations within the AMY. A greater understanding of the associative learning mechanisms that depend upon the AMY and related limbic and cortical structures, and the process by which drug cues come to gain control over behavior that maintains the addictive state, will facilitate the development of more effective addiction treatments. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2009.",,2010

METHOD(S): Bipolar stimulating electrodes were bilaterally placed in the NAcc using stereotactic coordinates. In the first study, P rats (9 animals) were allowed to establish a stable pattern of alcohol intake (about 5-7 g/day) over approximately 2 weeks, and the acute effects of DBS in the NAcc (140-150 Hz, 60-microsec pulse width, and 200-microA current intensity) on alcohol intake and alcohol preference were studied. Each animal acted as its own control and received 1 hour of DBS followed by 1 hour of sham-DBS or vice versa on each of 2 sequential days. The order of testing (sham-DBS vs DBS) was randomized. In the second study, each animal was allowed to establish a stable alcohol intake and then the animal was deprived of alcohol for 4-6 weeks. Animals received DBS (6 rats) or sham-DBS (5 rats) in the NAcc for 24 hours starting when alcohol was reintroduced to each animal. RESULT(S): Deep brain stimulation in the NAcc, as compared with a period of sham-DBS treatment in the same animals, acutely decreased alcohol preference. Furthermore, alcohol consumption and preference were significantly reduced in the DBS group compared with the sham treatment group during the first 24 hours that alcohol was made available after a period of forced abstinence. CONCLUSION(S): The NAcc plays a key role in the rewarding and subsequent addictive properties of drugs of abuse in general and of alcohol in particular. Deep brain stimulation in the NAcc reduced alcohol consumption in P rats both acutely and after a period of alcohol deprivation. Therefore, DBS in the NAcc coupled with other neurophysiological measurements may be a useful tool in determining the role of the NAcc in the mesocorticolimbic reward circuit. Deep brain stimulation in the NAcc may also be an effective treatment for reducing alcohol consumption in patients who abuse alcohol and have not responded to other forms of therapy.",Neurosurgical focus,Aug-10

transcranial magnetic stimulation","Increasing research efforts are focused on nonmotor aspects of Parkinson's disease (PD). Depression, anxiety, compulsivity (dopamine dysregulation symptoms), and hallucinations/psychosis are among these disorders, and all complicate the management of PD with negative influences on quality of life. There is a strong overlap between depression and apathy and likewise, depression and anxiety can coexist and require careful pharmacologic management. Dopamine dysregulation syndrome is linked to medication use and most clearly associated with dopamine agonists. In contrast, although hallucinations and psychosis do not occur unless patients with PD are treated with dopaminergic drugs, medication doses do not directly relate to this problem. Functional neuroimaging provides an excellent resource for investigating these behaviors as well as their anatomical and neurochemical bases. New treatments are being developed, but there have been very few large-scale randomized clinical trials to test the relative roles of new or available agents for abating these problematic behaviors. © 2010 Movement Disorder Society Copyright © 2010 Movement Disorder Society.",Movement Disorders,2010

Catecholaminergic function is related to impulsivity and mania. Manic individuals have abnormal dopaminergic reactions to reward and abnormal responses in the ventral prefrontal cortex that are consistent with impulsive behavior. Impulsivity in mania is pervasive, encompassing deficits in attention and behavioral inhibition. Impulsivity is increased with severe course of illness (eg, frequent episodes, substance use disorders, and suicide attempts). In mixed states, mania-associated impulsivity combines with depressive symptoms to increase the risk of suicide. Clinical management of impulsivity in mania involves addressing interpersonal distortions inherent in mania; reducing overstimulation; alertness to medical-, trauma-, or substance-related problems; and prompt pharmacologic treatment. Manic episodes must be viewed in the context of the life course of bipolar disorder. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Current Psychiatry Reports,Dec-09

This neurotoxicant has since been used extensively in nonhuman primates to induce an experimental model of Parkinson disease (PD). In this study, the authors examined the intraoperative physiological characteristics and efficacy of subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (DBS) in 1 of only 4 known living patients with MPTP-induced parkinsonism. The physiological recordings were consistent with recordings from MPTP-treated primates and humans with PD, thus providing further validation for the MPTP model in the study of the neurophysiology of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic deficit in PD. Furthermore, DBS produced a significant clinical improvement in this patient similar to the improvement seen after DBS in patients with idiopathic PD. This unique case has important implications for translational research that employs the MPTP-primate model for symptomatic therapy in PD.",Journal of Neurosurgery,Feb-09

substance abuse","Along with genetic vulnerability, multiple environmental factors convey liability to illness progression, including: (1) distal and proximal stressors; (2) recurrence of episodes; and (3) comorbid cocaine abuse. Recurrence of each of these can increase responsivity (sensitize) to themselves and cross-sensitize to the two other factors and drive illness progression as seen clinically in increases in cycle acceleration, severity or duration of episodes, treatment refractoriness, disability, cognitive dysfunction, and premature death. Some mechanisms appear common to all three types of sensitization, such as decreases of brain-derived neuroprotective factor (BDNF) in hippocampus and blood, as well as increases in BDNF in the nucleus accumbens, suggesting the possibility that single treatments could ameliorate several of these factors at once. A potential example is N-acetylcysteine (NAC), which decreases bipolar affective illness severity (Berk et al. Biol Psychiatry 64:468-475, 2008) and cocaine reinstatement and craving (Baker et al. Ann N Y Acad Sci 1003:349-351, 2003; LaRowe et al. Am J Addict 15:105-110, 2006). Mechanisms of illness progression also involve epigenetic changes and add further rationale to the existing empirical clinical evidence of the importance of early recognition, treatment, and prevention of affective episodes. Adequate treatment could prevent or ameliorate both the increases in pathological factors and erosion of adaptive factors that propel illness exacerbation and treatment resistance. This view of the sensitization and cross-sensitization among stressors, episodes, and abused substances should lead to a fundamental re-conceptualization of the recurrent affective disorders not as benign, isolated episodes of ""mental"" illness, but as severe, potentially progressive and lethal medical disorders of brain and body that deserve careful life-long monitoring and treatment. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Neurotoxicity Research,Nov-10

The diagnosis of ET is based on the presence of an action tremor of greater severity than enhanced physiological tremor, without other identifiable causes. Patients with ET experience a decrease in the performance of their motor skills and social activities, and a decline in their quality of life. The pathophysiology of ET is still not clear. Pharmacotherapy for ET is indicated if the disease interferes with the patients quality of life. Propranolol, a nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, and primidone, an antiepileptic, remain the standard treatments for ET. However, studies show that several other agents, including topiramate, gabapentin and zonisamide, might also be beneficial. Local injections of botulinum toxins and surgical interventions such as thalamic deep brain stimulation play a role as alternative options when pharmacological treatment is not satisfactory. Several new agents including 1-octanol, pregabalin and sodium oxybate are currently under investigation. © 2010 Adis Data Information BV. All rights reserved.",Drugs,2010

transcranial magnetic stimulation","Addiction is a devastating and chronically relapsing disorder. Repeated drug administration induces neuroadaptations associated with abnormal dopaminergic activity in the mesocorticolimbic circuitry, resulting in altered cortical neurotransmission and excitability. Electrical stimulation of specific brain regions can be used in animal models and humans to induce local activation or disruption of specific circuitries or alter neuronal excitability and cause neuroadaptations. Non-surgical stimulation of specific brain regions in human addicts can be achieved by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). TMS is used for transient stimulation or disruption of neural activity in specific cortical regions, which can be used to assess cortical excitability, and to induce changes in cortical excitability. Moreover, it is suggested that repeated stimulation can cause long-lasting neuroadaptations. Therefore, TMS paradigms were used in some studies to assess the presence of altered cortical excitability associated with chronic drug consumption, while other studies have begun to assess the therapeutic potential of repetitive TMS. Similarly, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is used to modulate neuronal resting membrane potential in humans and alter cortical excitability. The current review describes how these brain stimulation techniques have recently been used for the study and treatment of addiction in animal models and humans. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.",Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews,Mar-10

Here, in a pharmacological functional MRI study of the stop signal task, we show that methylphenidate (as compared with placebo) robustly decreased stop signal reaction time (SSRT), an index of improved control, in cocaine-dependent patients (a population in which inhibitory control is impaired). Methylphenidate-induced decreases in SSRT were positively correlated with inhibition-related activation of left middle frontal cortex (MFC) and negatively with activation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) in whole brain linear regressions. Inhibition-related MFC but not vmPFC activation distinguished individuals with short and long SSRT in 36 demographically matched healthy individuals, whereas vmPFC but not MFC activation, along with improvement in SSRT, was correlated with a previously implicated biomarker of methylphenidate response (systolic blood pressure). These results implicate a specific neural (i.e., vmPFC) mechanism whereby stimulants improve inhibitory control. Altered ventromedial prefrontal activation and increased blood pressure may represent useful CNS and peripheral biomarkers in individualized treatment with methylphenidate for patients with cocaine dependence.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,10-Aug-10

Several studies have shown involvement of the nucleus accumbens in these and other addictive behaviors. In this case report, we describe a patient who quit smoking and lost weight without any effort, and we review the underlying mechanisms of action. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 47-year-old woman presented with chronic treatment-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder, nicotine dependence, and obesity. INTERVENTION: The patient was treated with deep brain stimulation of the nucleus accumbens for obsessive-compulsive disorder. Unintended, effortless, and simultaneous smoking cessation and weight loss were observed. CONCLUSION(S): This study supports the idea of compulsivity with common circuitry in the processing of diverse rewards and suggests that deep brain stimulation of the nucleus accumbens could be a possible treatment of patients with a dependency not responding to currently available treatments.

However, recent research suggests that kappa receptor antagonists may reverse motivational aspects of dependence. In the present review, we revisit the studies that measured the effects of kappa receptor ligands on the reinforcing and rewarding effects of drugs and postulate underlying neurobiological mechanisms for these effects to elaborate a more complex view of the role of kappa receptor ligands in drug addiction. Results The review of studies indicates that kappa receptor stimulation generally antagonizes the acute reinforcing/rewarding effects of drugs whereas kappa receptor blockade has no consistent effect. However, in a drug dependent-like state, kappa receptor blockade was effective in reducing increased drug intake. In animal models of reinstatement, kappa receptor stimulation can induce reinstatement via a stresslike mechanism. Results in conditioned place preference/aversion and intracranial self-stimulation indicate that kappa receptor agonists produce, respectively, aversive-like and dysphoric-like effects. Additionally, preclinical and postmortem studies show that administration or selfadministration of cocaine, ethanol, and heroin activate the kappa opioid system. Conclusion kappa receptor agonists antagonize the reinforcing/rewarding effects of drugs possibly through punishing/aversive-like effects and reinstate drug seeking through stress-like effects. Evidence suggests that abused drugs activate the kappa opioid system, which may play a key role in motivational aspects of dependence. Kappa opioid systems may have an important role in driving compulsive drug intake. © Springer-Verlag 2010.",Psychopharmacology,Jun-10

To date, there have been published different jobs in psychiatry with good results in OCD, MDD and GAD. In our centre, (Hospital de Sant Pau, in Barcelona), we have made a randomized, double-blind and crossover study in 8 patients with MDD resistant to multiple treatments, using bilateral DBS in the subgenual area or Cg25. We obtained after 1 year follow up encouraging results: 87 % response and 70 % of clinical remission, with unimportant side effects. Focusing on the use of ECP in addictions, there is very little published, and almost all studies are preclinical. We'll give some data about some of them, as well as 2 of the articles that have been published in humans. This may open the door to future research on invasive techniques that affect the reward circuitry, and give the key to control craving in addictive disorders. © 2010 Elsevier Espana, S.L. and SET.

One group preferred 10 mg of d-amphetamine over placebo (Choosers) and the other preferred placebo (Nonchoosers). In separate sessions, participants were administered placebo, 10, and 15 mg of d-amphetamine, and event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded while participants performed two 3-stimulus oddball tasks. The effect of d-amphetamine on P3a, an ERP index of the orienting response, differed between groups: In Choosers, target stimuli elicited P3a after d-amphetamine but not after placebo; in Nonchoosers, the drug had no effect on P3a. Moreover, two group differences were evident after placebo and were unaffected by d-amphetamine. (1) N100 was larger in Nonchoosers than in Choosers, suggesting that Nonchoosers were more attentive than Choosers to the physical features of the stimuli. (2) The reorienting negativity (RON) elicited by targets in both tasks and by rare nontargets in a novelty oddball task (i.e., novel sounds) was larger in Nonchoosers than in Choosers. This suggests that Nonchoosers more effectively refocused attention on the task after distraction. It is hypothesized that these processing differences reflect a group difference in the balance between midbrain dopamine function and ascending cholinergic influences. The findings have implications for vulnerability to addiction and illustrate the promise of ERPs in parsing elemental phenotypes. © 2010 American Psychological Association.",Experimental and Clinical Psychopharmacology,Dec-10

The advent of neuroleptics led to a drastic decline in psychosurgery for several decades. Functional stereotactic neurosurgery has recently been revitalized, starting with treatment of Parkinson's disease, in which deep brain stimulation (DBS) facilitates reversible focal neuromodulation of altered basal ganglia circuits. DBS is now being extended to treatment of neuropsychiatric conditions such as Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression and addiction. In this review, we discuss the concept that dysfunction of motor, limbic and associative cortico-basal ganglia-thalamocortical loops underlies these various disorders, which might now be amenable to DBS treatment. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Trends in Neurosciences,Oct-10

review","Neurons that produce histamine are exclusively located in the tuberomamillary nucleus of the posterior hypothalamus and send widespread projections to almost all brain areas. Neuronal histamine is involved in many physiological and behavioral functions such as arousal, feeding behavior and learning. Although conflicting data have been published, several studies have also demonstrated a role of histamine in the psychomotor and rewarding effects of addictive drugs. Pharmacological and brain lesion experiments initially led to the proposition that the histaminergic system exerts an inhibitory influence on drug reward processes, opposed to that of the dopaminergic system. The purpose of this review is to summarize the relevant literature on this topic and to discuss whether the inhibitory function of histamine on drug reward is supported by current evidence from published results. Research conducted during the past decade demonstrated that the ability of many antihistaminic drugs to potentiate addiction-related behaviors essentially results from non-specific effects and does not constitute a valid argument in support of an inhibitory function of histamine on reward processes. The reviewed findings also indicate that histamine can either stimulate or inhibit the dopamine mesolimbic system through distinct neuronal mechanisms involving different histamine receptors. Finally, the hypothesis that the histaminergic system plays an inhibitory role on drug reward appears to be essentially supported by place conditioning studies that focused on morphine reward. The present review suggests that the development of drugs capable of activating the histaminergic system may offer promising therapeutic tools for the treatment of opioid dependence. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Progress in Neurobiology,Nov-10

*subthalamic nucleus

suicide / complication","Neurostimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an established treatment for motor symptoms in advanced Parkinson disease (PD), although concerns exist regarding the safety of this therapy in terms of cognitive and psychiatric adverse effects. The basal ganglia are considered to be part of distributed cortico-subcortical networks that are involved in the selection, facilitation and inhibition of movements, emotions, behaviors and thoughts. The STN has a central role in these networks, probably providing a global 'no-go' signal. The behavioral and cognitive effects observed following STN high-frequency stimulation (HFS) probably reflect the intrinsic role of this nucleus in nonmotor functional domains. Nevertheless, postoperative behavioral changes are seldom caused by such stimulation alone. PD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with motor, cognitive, behavioral and autonomic symptoms. The pattern of neurodegeneration and expression of these symptoms are highly variable across individuals. The preoperative neuropsychiatric state can be further complicated by sensitization phenomena resulting from long-term dopaminergic treatment, which include impulse control disorders, punding, and addictive behaviors (dopamine dysregulation syndrome). Finally, personality traits, the social environment, culture and learned behaviors might be important determinants explaining why behavioral symptoms differ between patients after surgery. Here, we summarize the neuropsychiatric changes observed after STN HFS and try to disentangle their various etiologies. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

In this review we focus our attention on recent advances made in understanding how stress, aversive events, and drugs of abuse, cocaine in particular, interact directly with dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area, and how these interactions may be involved in stress-induced relapse. We start by outlining how dopamine neurons respond to aversive stimuli and stress, particularly in terms of firing activity and modulation of excitatory synaptic inputs. We then discuss some of the cellular mechanisms underlying the effects of cocaine on dopamine neurons, again with a selective focus on synaptic plasticity. Finally, we examine how the effects of stress and cocaine interact and how these cellular mechanisms in ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons may be engaged in stress-induced relapse. © 2010.",Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews,Nov-10

social behavior","Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer (PIT) is a key concept in developing our understanding of cue-controlled behaviours. Here we have reviewed the literature on behavioural and neurobiological factors that influence PIT. Meta-analyses of the data for individual groups in PIT studies revealed that PIT is related to both the order and amounts of instrumental and Pavlovian training, and that it is critically determined by competition between instrumental and Pavlovian responses. We directly addressed the role of response competition in PIT in two experiments which showed that extensive Pavlovian conditioning produced more Pavlovian magazine visits and weaker PIT than moderate Pavlovian conditioning (Experiment 1); and that PIT lost after extensive Pavlovian conditioning was restored by Pavlovian extinction training (Experiment 2). These findings confirm that response competition is indeed an important determinant of PIT. This has significant implications for lesion and inactivation studies that assess the neurobiological substrates of PIT, as well as attempts to demonstrate PIT in the drug self-administration paradigm where the effect is yet to be reliably shown. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews,Jul-10

In this neuroimaging study, cue reactivity in problem gamblers (PRG) was compared with cue reactivity in heavy smokers (HSM) and healthy controls (HC). A functional magnetic resonance imaging event-related cue reactivity paradigm, consisting of gambling, smoking-related and neutral pictures, was employed in 17 treatment-seeking non-smoking PRG, 18 non-gambling HSM, and 17 non-gambling and non-smoking HC. Watching gambling pictures (relative to neutral pictures) was associated with higher brain activation in occipitotemporal areas, posterior cingulate cortex, parahippocampal gyrus and amygdala in PRG compared with HC and HSM. Subjective craving in PRG correlated positively with brain activation in left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and left insula. When comparing the HSM group with the two other groups, no significant differences in brain activity induced by smoking cues were found. In a stratified analysis, the HSM subgroup with higher Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence scores (FTND M = 5.4) showed higher brain activation in ventromedial prefrontal cortex, rostral anterior cingulate cortex, insula and middle/superior temporal gyrus while watching smoking-related pictures (relative to neutral pictures) than the HSM subgroup with lower FTND scores (FTND M = 2.9) and than non-smoking HC. Nicotine craving correlated with activation in left prefrontal and left amygdala when viewing smoking-related pictures in HSM. Increased regional responsiveness to gambling pictures in brain regions linked to motivation and visual processing is present in PRG, similar to neural mechanisms underlying cue reactivity in substance dependence. Increased brain activation in related fronto-limbic brain areas was present in HSM with higher FTND scores compared with HSM with lower FTND scores. © 2010 Society for the Study of Addiction.",Addiction Biology,Oct-10

Traditional models implicated the neural 'reward' system in providing a neurobiological model of addiction. Newer models however, have expanded on this circuitry to include two separate, but interconnecting systems, the limbic system in the incentive sensitization of drugs, and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in regulating inhibitory control over drug use. Until the recent developments in neuroimaging and brain stimulation techniques, it has been extremely difficult to assess the involvement of the PFC in addiction. In the current review, we explore the involvement of the frontostriatal circuitry in regulating inhibitory control, and suggest how dysregulation of these circuits could be involved in an increased difficulty in ceasing drug use. Following this, we investigate the recent neuropsychological, neuroimaging and brain stimulation studies that explore the presence of these inhibitory deficits, and frontostriatal dysfunctions, across various different substance groups. Further insight into these deficits could contribute to the development of treatment strategies which target these cognitive impairments, and frontostriatal dysfunction, in reducing drug-seeking behaviors. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews,Nov-10

withdrawal syndrome","Reductionist attempts to dissect complex mechanisms into simpler elements are necessary, but not sufficient for understanding how biological properties like reward emerge out of neuronal activity. Recent studies on intracranial self-administration of neurochemicals (drugs) found that rats learn to self-administer various drugs into the mesolimbic dopamine structures-the posterior ventral tegmental area, medial shell nucleus accumbens and medial olfactory tubercle. In addition, studies found roles of non-dopaminergic mechanisms of the supramammillary, rostromedial tegmental and midbrain raphe nuclei in reward.To explain intracranial self-administration and related effects of various drug manipulations, I outlined a neurobiological theory claiming that there is an intrinsic central process that coordinates various selective functions (including perceptual, visceral, and reinforcement processes) into a global function of approach. Further, this coordinating process for approach arises from interactions between brain structures including those structures mentioned above and their closely linked regions: the medial prefrontal cortex, septal area, ventral pallidum, bed nucleus of stria terminalis, preoptic area, lateral hypothalamic areas, lateral habenula, periaqueductal gray, laterodorsal tegmental nucleus and parabrachical area. © 2010.",Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews,Nov-10

Dysfunction of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is associated with craving. We investigated whether stimulation of the DLPFC reduces food craving in people with a bulimic-type eating disorder. Method(s): Thirty-eight people with bulimic-type eating disorders were randomly allocated to receive one session of real or sham high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the left DLPFC in a double-blind procedure. Outcome measures included self-reported food craving immediately after the stimulation session and frequency of bingeing over a 24-hour follow-up period. Result(s): Compared with sham control, real rTMS was associated with decreased self-reported urge to eat and fewer binge-eating episodes over the 24 hours following stimulation. Conclusion(s): High-frequency rTMS of the left DLPFC lowers cue-induced food cravings in people with a bulimic eating disorder and may reduce binge eating. These results provide a rationale for exploring rTMS as a treatment for bulimic eating disorders. © 2010 Society of Biological Psychiatry.",Biological Psychiatry,15-Apr-10

spinal cord stimulation","Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has dramatically changed the landscape of neurosurgery. Overall, the technique consists of the delivery of current into the brain parenchyma through implanted electrodes (Figure 1). It is estimated that 60,000 patients worldwide have received DBS, with the rate of accrual currently approaching 8,000 to 10,000 new patients a year. Although electrical stimulation has been used for more than 50 years to treat psychiatric disorders and pain, the technique as conducted today reemerged some 25 years ago, in the field of movement disorders. The striking clinical effects of DBS in these conditions and the similarities in outcome between stimulation and lesions soon prompted the investigation of the technique for various diseases previously treated by functional neurosurgeons. Equally important for the development of the therapy were imaging and electrophysiological studies. Because DBS modulates local neuronal activity and influences regions at a distance from the stimulated site, dysfunctional anatomic circuits and structures have been regarded as potential targets. Animal research has provided the rationale for the use of DBS in some applications of the therapy, although most experimental studies have been conducted to explore potential mechanisms for the effects of stimulation.",Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics,Oct-10

substantia nigra","Anhedonia, as a failure to experience rewarding stimuli, is a key characteristic of many psychiatric disorders including depression and schizophrenia. Investigations on the neurobiological correlates of reward and hedonia/anhedonia have been a growing subject of research demonstrating several neuromodulators to mediate different aspects of reward processing. Whereas the majority of research on reward mainly focused on the dopamine and opioid systems, a serotonergic mechanism has been neglected. However, recent promising results strengthen the pivotal role of serotonin in reward processing. Evidence includes electrophysical and pharmacological as well as genetic and imaging studies. Primate research using single-unit recording of neurons within the dorsal raphe nucleus argues for a serotonergic mediation of reward value, whereas studies using intracranial self-stimulation point to an important contribution of serotonin in modulating motivational aspects of rewarding brain stimulation. Pharmacological studies using agonists and antagonists of serotonergic receptor subtypes and approaches investigating an increase or decrease of the extracellular level of serotonin offer strong evidence for a serotonergic mediation, ranging from aversion to pleasure. This review provides an argument for serotonin as a fundamental mediator of emotional, motivational and cognitive aspects of reward representation, which makes it possibly as important as dopamine for reward processing. © 2010 IBRO.",Neuroscience,14-Apr-10

withdrawal syndrome","Cognitive deficits that are reported in heavy marijuana users (attention, memory, affect perception, decision-making) appear to be completely reversible after a prolonged abstinence period of about 28 days. However, it remains unclear whether the reversibility of these cognitive deficits indicates that (1) chronic marijuana use is not associated with long-lasting changes in cortical networks or (2) that such changes occur but the brain adapts to and compensates for the drug-induced changes. Therefore, we examined whether chronic marijuana smokers would demonstrate a differential pattern of response in comparison to healthy volunteers on a decision-making paradigm (Risk Task) while undergoing sham or active transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Twenty-five chronic marijuana users who were abstinent for at least 24. h were randomly assigned to receive left anodal/right cathodal tDCS of DLPFC (n=8), right anodal/left cathodal tDCS of DLPFC (n=9), or sham stimulation (n=8); results on Risk Task during sham/active tDCS were compared to healthy volunteers from a previously published dataset. Chronic marijuana users demonstrated more conservative (i.e. less risky) decision-making during sham stimulation. While right anodal stimulation of the DLPFC enhanced conservative decision-making in healthy volunteers, both right anodal and left anodal DLPFC stimulation increased the propensity for risk-taking in marijuana users. These findings reveal alterations in the decision-making neural networks among chronic marijuana users. Finally, we also assessed the effects of tDCS on marijuana craving and observed that right anodal/left cathodal tDCS of DLPFC is significantly associated with a diminished craving for marijuana. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Drug and Alcohol Dependence,01-Dec-10

It has many different manifestations and causes, and many different treatment options are available. These options include physical and occupational therapy, oral medications, intramuscular injection of botulinum toxins, and neurosurgical interventions. Areas covered in this review: In this review, we first summarize the treatment options available, then we provide suggestions from our own experience for how these can be applied in different types of dystonia. In preparing this review article, an extensive literature search was undertaken using PubMed. Only selected references from 1970 to 2008 are cited. What the reader will gain: This review is intended to provide the clinician with a practical guide to the treatment of dystonia. Take home message: Treatment of dystonia begins with proper diagnosis and classification, followed by an appropriate search for underlying etiology, and an assessment of the functional impairment associated with the dystonia. The therapeutic approach, which is usually limited to symptomatic therapy, must then be tailored to the individual needs of the patient.",Expert Opinion on Pharmacotherapy,Jan-10

Risk factors include the amount of l-dopa administered, gender and patient age. Continuous duodenal l-dopa or subcutaneous apomorphine infusions are helpful strategies because they can control motor complications by providing continuous dopaminergic drug delivery. Apomorphine subcutaneous infusion provides a motor benefit similar to that of dopamine and is relatively easy to use in advanced PD. However, it commonly requires concomitant administration of oral l-dopa and its long-term use is limited by compliance. Continuous administration of l-dopa/carbidopa by infusion in the duodenum/jejunum is a more complex procedure requiring a gastrostomy for the placement of the infusion tube, but it allows replacement of all oral medications and the achievement of a satisfactory therapeutic response paralleled by a reduction of motor complication severity. It should be noted that although these procedures are effective, most evidence relates to small case series and, particularly in the case of apomorphine, despite its long-term availability, there is a complete lack of randomized blinded studies. In addition, unlike deep brain stimulation, it is unclear which patients are the best candidates for these procedures, making any indirect comparison very complex, given the clinical heterogeneity of reported patients. This has consequences in resource allocation and in estimating cost-benefit ratios for these complex therapies in advanced PD. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Much like movement disorders, the targets selected for DBS are based on past experience with stereotactic lesions. A literature review of past studies incorporating stereotactic lesions for psychiatric disorders was performed to provide historical context and possible guidance for current and future attempts at treating psychiatric disorders with DBS. Methods. Original copies of the proceedings of the second, third, fourth, and fifth World Congresses of Psychiatric Surgery meetings were reviewed, and a Medline search was conducted for studies with the word ""psychosurgery"" and each of 14 highly prevalent psychiatric conditions identified by the National Institute of Mental Health. Postoperative results for 1145 patients with stereotactic brain lesions targeting various anatomical foci were standardized using a 5-point scale (3 [free of symptoms] to -1 [worse]). Each patient was entered into a database as a unique data point and used for this literature review. Results. General anxiety disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder had the greatest reported improvements from anterior capsulotomy, and bipolar disorder, depression, and schizoaffective disorder had the greatest reported improvements from anterior cingulotomy, supporting these areas for DBS investigation. Addiction and schizophrenia showed the least improvement from surgery. Therefore, pursuing the treatment of these disorders with DBS using the targets in these studies may be ineffective. Conclusions. This study provides retrospective data that suggest which anatomical focus may be effective to lesion or stimulate for the treatment of each of several psychiatric disorders.",Journal of Neurosurgery,Dec-10

substance abuse","Since approximately 10 years investigations have been carried out on the impact of deep brain stimulation (DBS) of treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorders and depression. New fields of application are for Tourette's syndrome, substance abuse, dementia and anxiety. New functional, structural and molecular data have led to a new conceptualization of these disorders as dysfunctions of networks which process motivational and affective stimuli. DBS permits the selective and basically reversible modulation of such networks. So far adverse effects have been graded as marginal. In the field of treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorders and depressive disorders uncontrolled studies have been published with initial satisfactory and concordant indications of the therapeutic effect of DBS in a variety of target areas of the brain. It is most important to provide a consistent interdisciplinary and durable development of concepts for a responsible use of DBS in patients with psychiatric disorders. Only in this way can the potentially most interesting therapeutic development of clinical psychiatry of the last 20 years be continued uninterrupted. © Springer-Verlag 2010.",Nervenarzt,Jun-10

Objective(s): To review general aspects of the association between anxiety and PD concerning prevalence, etiopathogenesis, clinical characteristics, comorbidities, and treatment. Method(s): The basic and clinical literature on anxiety and PD was reviewed via the Pubmed, Lilacs and Scielo indexing services, using the keywords anxiety, etiology, prevalence, treatment, Parkinson, and Parkinson's disease. Moreover, complementary information was extracted from the reference lists of the articles found in the search. Result(s): Up to 67% of PD patients present clinically significant anxiety levels. Oscillations in anxious symptoms may be related to the use of anti-Parkinson drugs and motor fluctuations. The association between anxiety in PD and depressive disorders sleep disturbances, and cognitive impairment has also been proposed as a possible explanation for this psychiatric complication. Thus far, few data on the treatment of anxiety disorders in PD are available. Conclusion(s): More studies investigating aspects such as prevalence, etiopathogenesis, comorbidities, impact on life quality, and treatment are necessary and opportune in order to facilitate the recognition and diagnosis of anxiety disorders in PD. © 2009 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",Current Psychiatry Reviews,2009

ubiquitination","By the time a patient first presents with symptoms of Parkinson's disease at the clinic, a significant proportion (50-70%) of the cells in the substantia nigra (SN) has already been destroyed. This degeneration progresses until, within a few years, most of the cells have died. Except for rare cases of familial PD, the initial trigger for cell loss is unknown. However, we do have some clues as to why the damage, once initiated, progresses unabated. It would represent a major advance in therapy to arrest cell loss at the stage when the patient first presents at the clinic. Current therapies for Parkinson's disease focus on relieving the motor symptoms of the disease, these unfortunately lose their effectiveness as the neurodegeneration and symptoms progress. Many experimental approaches are currently being investigated attempting to alter the progression of the disease. These range from replacement of the lost neurons to neuroprotective therapies; each of these will be briefly discussed in this review. The main thrust of this review is to explore the interactions between dopamine, alpha synuclein and redox-active metals. There is abundant evidence suggesting that destruction of SN cells occurs as a result of a self-propagating series of reactions involving dopamine, alpha synuclein and redox-active metals. A potent reducing agent, the neurotransmitter dopamine has a central role in this scheme, acting through redox metallo-chemistry to catalyze the formation of toxic oligomers of alpha-synuclein and neurotoxic metabolites including 6-hydroxydopamine. It has been hypothesized that these feed the cycle of neurodegeneration by generating further oxidative stress. The goal of dissecting and understanding the observed pathological changes is to identify therapeutic targets to mitigate the progression of this debilitating disease. © 2009 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",Current Neuropharmacology,2009

These disorders include hypersexuality, gambling and, to a minor extent, compulsive shopping and eating, as well as dopamine dysregulation syndrome, characterized by an addictive pattern toward dopamine replacement therapy and stereotyped behaviors, such as punding. These syndromes, which have only recently been recognized and are still underdiagnosed, have deleterious social consequences that warrant interventions at the clinical level and promotion of research at the preclinical level. In this review, we first provide a summary of features of Parkinson's disease and current pharmacological therapies associated with the development of dopamine dysregulation syndrome and impulsive-compulsive disorders. We also examine the dopamine receptors and brain areas important in reward and compulsive behaviors. We then critically examine the neuroadaptations in dopaminergic circuitries and the literature concerning gambling, hypersexuality, and other addictive behaviors in parkinsonian patients. Finally, we focus on suggestions pointing to a role for dopamine D3 receptors and sensitization phenomena as the main factors which may be the origin of these disorders. © 2009 Wolters Kluwer Health Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Behavioural Pharmacology,Sep-09

screening test","Antiparkinson therapy can be the primary cause of a range of nonmotor symptoms that include a set of complex disinhibitory psychomotor pathologies and are linked by their repetitive, reward or incentive-based natures. These behaviors relate to aberrant or excessive dopamine receptor stimulation and encompass impulse control disorders (ICDs), punding, and the dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS). Common ICDs include pathological gambling, hypersexuality, compulsive eating, and compulsive buying. This review focuses on the phenomenology, epidemiology, and methods to identify and rate these disorders. The management of dopaminergic drug-related compulsive behaviors is discussed in the light of the current understanding of the neurobiological substrate of these disorders. © 2009 Movement Disorder Society.",Movement Disorders,15-Aug-09

stereotactic procedure","This review outlines and compares current attempts at the treatment of psychiatric disorders through neurosurgical techniques. In particular, we have undertaken to compare the results of lesioning techniques with those of stimulation of the brain. The original lesioning techniques, and in particular the use of frontal lobotomy as used and developed at the end of the 19th century and early 20th century represent an interesting period of strong interplay between the neurosurgery and psychiatry and are described in the first section. With the advent of modern stereotaxy, more selective procedures were developed that were also guided by concurrent advances in the neurosciences and the early interpretations of the limbic circuitry. These selective procedures included the anterior cingulotomy, the anterior capsulotomy, the subcaudate tractotomy, and the general limbic leucotomy. A discussion of implementation of these procedures and their neurobiologic justification has also been included in the second section. Besides being the targets of procedures, which cause gross mechanical disruption, several of these brain regions have been used as radiosurgical targets, and are also being considered for electrical stimulation as a treatment modality. The next 3 sections of the review focus on the newer uses of deep brain stimulation for treating specifically major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and Tourette syndrome. Several choices of targets are described for these diseases along with their proposed physiologic rationale. The sixth section subsequently compares the lesioning and stimulation techniques with a particular focus on their relative merits and complications. © 2009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.",Neurosurgery Quarterly,Jun-09

tobacco dependence","Aims: We explore whether clinical research on deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) to treat addiction is justified besides theoretical speculation. Method(s): Since 2004, 10 patients who were also smokers were treated at the University of Cologne for Tourette's syndrome (TS), obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD) or anxiety disorders (AD) by DBS of the NAc. We assessed their smoking behavior after DBS and (in retrospection) before by the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) and additional items. Result(s): Three male patients were able to quit smoking after DBS. They were less dependent and higher motivated compared to the rest of the sample. They are stimulated with a higher voltage. During 1-year, 2-year, and 30-month follow-ups, we found a higher rate of successful smoking cessation (20, 30 and 30%) compared to unaided smoking cessation in the general population (13, 19 and 8.7%). Conclusion(s): Albeit the results of the study are severely limited by the method of retrospective self-assessment of psychiatric patients, further research of DBS of the NAc to treat addiction seems justified. In addition to biological mediators, psychosocial factors should be assessed in further prospective studies. Copyright © 2009 S. Karger AG, Basel.",European Addiction Research,Oct-09

smoking habit","More than 94 million Americans have tried marijuana, and it remains the most widely used illicit drug in the nation. Investigations of the cognitive effects of marijuana report alterations in brain function during tasks requiring executive control, including inhibition and decision-making. Endogenous cannabinoids regulate a variety of emotional responses, including anxiety, mood control, and aggression; nevertheless, little is known about smokers' responses to affective stimuli. The anterior cingulate and amygdala play key roles in the inhibition of impulsive behavior and affective regulation, and studies using PET and fMRI have demonstrated changes within these regions in marijuana smokers. Given alterations in mood and perception often observed in smokers, we hypothesized altered fMRI patterns of response in 15 chronic heavy marijuana smokers relative to 15 non-marijuana smoking control subjects during the viewing of masked happy and fearful faces. Despite no between-group differences on clinical or demographic measures, smokers demonstrated a relative decrease in both anterior cingulate and amygdalar activity during masked affective stimuli compared to controls, who showed relative increases in activation within these regions during the viewing of masked faces. Findings indicate that chronic heavy marijuana smokers demonstrate altered activation of frontal and limbic systems while viewing masked faces, consistent with autoradiographic studies reporting high CB-1 receptor density in these regions. These data suggest differences in affective processing in chronic smokers, even when stimuli are presented below the level of conscious processing, and underscore the likelihood that marijuana smokers process emotional information differently from those who do not smoke, which may result in negative consequences. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We present a case series of 21 operated PD patients who had exhibited DDS, ICDs or punding at some stage during the disease. DDS remained unimproved or worsened post-operatively in 12/17 patients with pre-operative DDS (71%) (nine bilateral subthalamic nucleus [STN], one right-sided STN, two bilateral globus pallidus internus [GPi] DBS). DDS improved or resolved after bilateral STN DBS in 5/17 patients with pre-operative DDS. DDS apparently developed for the first time after bilateral STN DBS in two patients, although only after a latency of eight years in one case. One patient without reported pre-operative DDS or ICDs developed pathological gambling post-STN DBS. One patient had pathological gambling which resolved pre-operatively, and did not recur post-DBS. Thus, DDS, ICDs and punding may persist, worsen or develop for the first time after DBS surgery, although a minority of patients improved dramatically. Predictive factors may include physician vigilance, motor outcome and patient compliance. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Journal of Clinical Neuroscience,Sep-09

After previous medical treatment with Propranolol and Primidone failed, the patient resorted to alcohol, which greatly alleviated the symptoms. The downside of this situation, however, was that it led to alcoholism with severely disturbed liver enzymes and hepatic steatosis. Methods & Results: After DBS the patient was free of tremor and thus could easily abstain from alcohol. Conclusion(s): In time the elevated liver enzymes returned to normal, which indicates that sufficient tremor control by DBS can help these patients to abstain from alcohol. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.",Acta Neurochirurgica,Oct-09

The technique improves patients' quality of life, disability, motor complications and allows the dose of dopaminergic treatment to be reduced. The dramatic motor benefits provided by the technique were firstly accompanied by a number of psychiatric complications - depression hypomania or mania, anxiety disorders or behavioural disorders - reflecting both the deleterious effect of modulation of the limbic circuit and the (inapropriate) selection of patients with past history of severe psychiatric disorders. Following a number of prospective studies, it is now considered that the rate of severe psychiatric side effects induced by deep brain stimulation is low, provided that the patients are well selected, the electrodes adequately placed and the postoperative follow-up appropriately performed. Intrestingly, the favourable effects of the technique on both anxiety disorders (particularly obsessive compulsive disorders) and some behavioural disorders (mainly repetitive behaviour), strongly suggests that deep brain stimulation-associated modulation of associative and limbic circuits -through the basal ganglia - might be the method of choice for the futur treatment of severe and medically refractory neuropsychiatric disorders such as Tourett's syndrome, obsessive compulsive disorders and addiction disorders. © 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Under the spell of this ideology and the false promise of instant riches, the America's immigrant values of thrift, prudence and community concern - traditionally the foundation of the American Dream - have been hijacked by an all-consuming self-interest. That the human animal is a curiosity-driven pleasure seeker easily seduced is of no surprise to the behavioral neuroscientist. ""Overloading"" the brain's ancient reward circuits with excessive stimulation - through drugs, novel experience, or unlimited choice - will trigger craving and insatiable desire. When desire is lost we call it anhedonia -or depression -and consider it an illness. But when the brain's reward circuits are overloaded or unconstrained, then desire can turn to craving and to an addictive greed that co-opts executive analysis and commonsense. Adam Smith - the eighteenth century Scottish philosopher and capitalism's patron saint - believed that ""self-love"" (instinctual self-interest) within the give and take of a market framework would create a self-regulating economic order. Today the tethers that gave us Adam Smith's enduring metaphor of an ""invisible hand"" balancing market behavior, have been weakened by an intrusive mercantilism that never sleeps. Before 1985 American consumers saved on average about 9% of their disposable income but by 2005 the comparable savings rate was zero as mortgage, credit card and other consumer debt rose to 127% of disposable income. America had transformed itself from the world's bank to a debtor nation. With the nation's financial system at the brink of disaster we found ourselves rudely awake. Now with reality challenging the laissez faire ideology of recent decades we have the opportunity to take stock with a renewed self-awareness, to curb our addictive striving and to reach beyond immediate reward to craft a vigorous, equitable and sustainable market society - one where technology and profit serve as instruments in achieving the good life and are not confused with the good life itself.",Neuropsychiatria i Neuropsychologia,2009

While apomorphine provides a similar level of motor benefit to levodopa, its long-term use is limited by compliance and injection site skin reactions. The administration of levodopa/carbidopa by continuous duodenal infusion allows replacement of all oral medications and permits achievement of a satisfactory therapeutic response paralleled by a reduction in motor complication severity. However, compared with apomorphine, it is more invasive as it requires a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy. In this review we discuss the advantages and limitations of these procedures and how they compare to deep brain stimulation. We also address the issue of selection criteria and propose clinical characteristics of candidates to help the clinician choose the most suitable option for their patients. © 2009 Expert Reviews Ltd.",Expert Review of Neurotherapeutics,Jun-09

syndrome","Impulse control disorders (ICDs) are a heterogeneous group of conditions involving repetitive, excessive and compulsive activities that interfere with life functioning. Examples are pathological gambling, compulsive shopping and hypersexuality. Over the last decade, ICDs have become increasingly recognised as being associated with Parkinson disease (PD), with the literature highlighting a link between dopamine replacement therapy and the development of ICDs. Patients who develop ICDs in the context of compulsive anti-Parkinsonian drug use are described as having dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS), which is associated with repetitive complex stereotyped behaviours called punding. Case-control and observational studies have further noted that patients with PD who develop ICDs are more likely to have younger-onset PD, a history of alcohol dependence, novelty-seeking personality traits and psychiatric comorbidities. The pathophysiology of underlying mechanisms is not fully understood, but recent evidence suggests that dopaminergic drugs, particularly dopamine agonists, coupled with changes in reward pathways involving the ventral striatal and related circuitry, may play a role. Neuroimaging studies using positron emission tomography and functional MRI have provided valuable information in this area: patients with DDS have been found to show enhanced dopamine release in the ventral striatum, suggesting functional abnormalities in the mesolimbic networks. Management of ICDs in patients with PD can be challenging, as they may not be aware of a change in their behaviour or may conceal their symptoms to avoid embarrassment. Currently, there is no clear evidence of an optimal treatment. Management is based on a careful balance of dopaminergic drugs with control of the aberrant behaviour, supported by psychological interventions. This review aims to summarise the current literature on ICDs, their phenomenology, epidemiology, clinical features, pathophysiology and management.",Postgraduate Medical Journal,Nov-09

Result(s): Stereotactic neurosurgery has shown promising results in reducing drug addiction, but it has also caused severe side effects. Thus, surgeons have sought to refine the stereotactic lesion procedure and its target over the past 50 years. Conclusions and Significance: Recent developments in stereotactic technique and deep brain stimulation (DBS) maymake stereotactic neurosurgery a viable and reversible treatment for drug addiction.",American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse,15-Dec-09

treatment outcome","Treatment of Parkinsons disease has traditionally focused on the management of motor disability while behavioural disturbances have received less attention. Recently, impulse control disorders and aberrant repetitive behaviours have surged to clinical relevance as they occur during dopamine replacement treatment (mainly with dopamine agonists) and worsen patient and caregiver quality of life. Patients are unable to adequately estimate the negative consequences of their actions and are prone to entertain compulsive reward-seeking activities.This review aims to summarize current evidence on the epidemiology of behavioural disturbances in Parkinsons disease, recent insights into their neurobiological basis and to discuss strategies for management and prevention. Studies from 1990 through to December 2008 were retrieved via searches of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and PubMed.The mechanisms underlying the development of behavioural disturbances in Parkinsons disease are debated but current evidence points to specific risk factors: male sex, young age at onset, underlying personality traits characterized by high impulsivity and novelty seeking, and personal or family history of addictive disorders. Specifically, in predisposed individuals dopamine replacement therapy leads to overstimulation of dopamine receptors within the mesocorticolimbic pathways and in turn to the development of addictive behaviours, such as impulse control disorders and compulsive medication intake. Since these disturbances affect individuals who have often unremarkable psychiatric history and no cognitive impairment, their identification and management is complex. Compulsive medication intake (described as 'hedonistic homeostatic dysregulation' or 'dopamine dysregulation syndrome') is commonly associated with fluctuations in advanced disease, while impulse control disorders frequently occur in early Parkinsons disease and within normal-range medication dosages.Management primarily requires reduction of dopaminergic therapy but psychosocial support is often required. Use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in the dose used for obsessive compulsive disorders may help, while benefit from atypical antipsychotics is limited in most cases. Deep brain stimulation should be considered with caution in these subjects. Prevention is based on the identification of at-risk individuals and active monitoring. Given the social and potentially medical-legal consequences of these behaviours, we encourage treating physicians to discuss risks with patients before treatment is initiated. © 2009 Adis Data Information BV.

review","Extinction is a form of inhibitory learning that suppresses a previously conditioned response. Both fear and drug seeking are conditioned responses that can lead to maladaptive behavior when expressed inappropriately, manifesting as anxiety disorders and addiction, respectively. Recent evidence indicates that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is critical for the extinction of both fear and drug-seeking behaviors. Moreover, a dorsal-ventral distinction is apparent within the mPFC, such that the prelimbic (PL-mPFC) cortex drives the expression of fear and drug seeking, whereas the infralimbic (IL-mPFC) cortex suppresses these behaviors after extinction. For conditioned fear, the dorsal-ventral dichotomy is accomplished via divergent projections to different subregions of the amygdala, whereas for drug seeking, it is accomplished via divergent projections to the subregions of the nucleus accumbens. Given that the mPFC represents a common node in the extinction circuit for these behaviors, treatments that target this region may help alleviate symptoms of both anxiety and addictive disorders by enhancing extinction memory. © 2009 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.",Learning and Memory,May-09

*synaptic transmission","The 'omnipresence' of adenosine in all nervous system cells (neurons and glia) together with the intensive release of adenosine following insults, makes adenosine as a sort of 'maestro' of synapses leading to the homeostatic coordination of brain function. Besides direct actions of adenosine on the neurosecretory mechanisms, where adenosine operates to tune neurotransmitter release, receptor-receptor interactions as well as interplays between adenosine receptors and transporters occur as part of the adenosine's attempt to fine tuning synaptic transmission. This review will focus on the different ways adenosine can use to trigger or brake the action of several neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. Adenosine receptors cross talk with other G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), with ionotropic receptors and with receptor kinases. Most of these interactions occur through A2A receptors, which in spite their low density in some brain areas, such as the hippocampus, may function as metamodulators. Tonic adenosine A2A receptor activity is a required step to allow synaptic actions of neurotrophic factors, namely upon synaptic transmission at both pre- and post-synaptic level as well as upon synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival. The implications of these interactions in normal brain functioning and in neurologic and psychiatric dysfunction will be discussed. © 2009 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",Current Neuropharmacology,2009

Also highlighted are applications of each of the components as methods of investigating central nervous system pathology. The guidelines are intended to assist investigators who use ERPs in clinical research, in an effort to provide clear and concise recommendations and thereby to standardize methodology and facilitate comparability of data across laboratories. © 2009 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.",Clinical Neurophysiology,Nov-09

Dysfunction of the nucleus accumbens, one of the main areas of the brain's reward system, seems to play a central role in addiction and treatment resistance. Following the recent advances of neuromodulation therapy by deep brain stimulation, we designed an off-label single patient study protocol to treat patients with severe and long-standing alcoholism in whom other treatment options had failed. We report here on the first three patients with alcoholism who received deep brain stimulation. In the one-year follow-up period, two remained abstinent, while one showed a remarkable reduction of days while drinking and none had any significant adverse effects. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.",Pharmacopsychiatry,Nov-09

thalamus","Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has proven to be capable of providing significant benefits for several neuropathologies. It is highly effective in reducing the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, and dystonia, and in alleviating chronic pain. Recently, also Tourette syndrome, obsessive-compulsive disorder and treatment-resistant depression have been treated by DBS with encouraging results. However, despite these clinical achievements, the precise action mechanisms of DBS still need to be fully characterized. For this reason, several animal models of DBS have been developed, bringing new insights on the effects of this treatment at molecular and cellular level, and providing new evidence on its physiological and behavioral consequences. In parallel, physiological and imaging studies in patients have contributed to better understanding DBS impact on the function of brain circuits. Here we review the clinical data and experimental work in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo (mostly arisen from studies on DBS of the subthalamic nucleus) in the treatment of PD, which led to the actual knowledge of DBS mechanisms, from molecular to complex behavioral levels. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

walking","Since the 1960s, deep brain stimulation and spinal cord stimulation at low frequency (30 Hz) have been used to treat intractable pain of various origins. For this purpose, specific hardware have been designed, including deep brain electrodes, extensions, and implantable programmable generators (IPGs). In the meantime, movement disorders, and particularly parkinsonian and essential tremors, were treated by electrolytic or mechanic lesions in various targets of the basal ganglia, particularly in the thalamus and in the internal pallidum. The advent in the 1960s of levodopa, as well as the side effects and complications of ablative surgery (e.g., thalamotomy and pallidotomy), has sent functional neurosurgery of movement disorders to oblivion. In 1987, the serendipitous discovery of the effect of high-frequency stimulation (HFS), mimicking lesions, allowed the revival of the surgery of movement disorders by stimulation of the thalamus, which treated tremors with limited morbidity, and adaptable and reversible results. The stability along time of these effects allowed extending it to new targets suggested by basic research in monkeys. The HFS of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) has profoundly challenged the practice of functional surgery as the effect on the triad of dopaminergic symptoms was very significant, allowing to decrease the drug dosage and therefore a decrease of their complications, the levodopa-induced dyskinesias. In the meantime, based on the results of previous basic research in various fields, HFS has been progressively extended to potentially treat epilepsy and, more recently, psychiatric disorders, such as obsessive-compulsive disorders, Gilles de la Tourette tics, and severe depression. Similarly, suggested by the observation of changes in PET scan, applications have been extended to cluster headaches by stimulation of the posterior hypothalamus and even more recently, to obesity and drug addiction. In the field of movement disorders, it has become clear that STN stimulation is not efficient on the nondopaminergic symptoms such as freezing of gait. Based on experimental data obtained in MPTP-treated parkinsonian monkeys, the pedunculopontine nucleus has been used as a new target, and as suggested by the animal research results, its use indeed improves walking and stability when stimulation is performed at low frequency (25 Hz). The concept of simultaneous stimulation of multiple targets eventually at low or high frequency, and that of several electrodes in one target, is being accepted to increase the efficiency. This leads to and is being facilitated by the development of new hardware (multiple-channel IPGs, specific electrodes, rechargeable batteries). Still additional efforts are needed at the level of the stimulation paradigm and in the waveform. The recent development of nanotechnologies allows the design of totally new systems expanding the field of deep brain stimulation. These new techniques will make it possible to not only inhibit or excite deep brain structures to alleviate abnormal symptoms but also open the field for the use of recording cortical activities to drive neuroprostheses through brain-computer interfaces. The new field of compensation of deficits will then become part of the field of functional neurosurgery. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,2009

priority journal","The neurobehavioral underpinnings of pathological gambling are not well understood. Insight might be gained by understanding pharmacological effects on the reward system in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Treatment with dopamine agonists (DAs) has been associated with pathological gambling in PD patients. However, how DAs are involved in the development of this form of addiction is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that tonic stimulation of dopamine receptors specifically desensitizes the dopaminergic reward system by preventing decreases in dopaminergic transmission that occurs with negative feedback. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we studied PD patients during three sessions of a probabilistic reward task in random order: off medication, after levodopa (LD) treatment, and after an equivalent dose of DA (pramipexole). For each trial, a reward prediction error value was computed using outcome, stake, and probability. Pramipexole specifically changed activity of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in two ways that were both associated with increased risk taking in an out-of-magnet task. Outcome-induced activations were generally higher with pramipexole compared with LD or off medication. In addition, only pramipexole greatly diminished trial-by-trial correlation with reward prediction error values. Further analysis yielded that this resulted mainly from impaired deactivation in trials with negative errors in reward prediction. We propose that DAs prevent pauses in dopamine transmission and thereby impair the negative reinforcing effect of losing. Our findings raise the question of whether pathological gambling may in part stem from an impaired capacity of the OFC to guide behavior when facing negative consequences. © 2009 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.",Neuropsychopharmacology,Dec-09

Subunit expression was influenced by the subject's genotype. The TaqIA polymorphism selectively modulated NMDA receptor mean transcript expression in cirrhotic-alcoholic superior frontal cortex, in diametrically opposite ways in male and female subjects. Genetic make-up may differentially influence vulnerability to brain damage by altering the excitation: inhibition balance, particularly in alcoholics with comorbid cirrhosis of the liver. The TaqIA polymorphism occurs within the poorly characterised ankyrin-repeat containing kinase 1 (ANKK1) gene. Using PCR, ANKK1 mRNA transcript was detected in inferior temporal, occipital, superior frontal and primary motor cortex of control human brain. ANKK1 expression may mediate the influence of the TaqIA polymorphism on phenotype. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Neurochemical Research,Oct-09

There is substantial evidence for glutamatergic projections into mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic neurons, which are associated with opioid psychological dependence and are also the key regions of enhancement effect. Glutamate may be involved in the process of opioid addiction not only by acting on its ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors that activate several signal transduction pathways, but also by interacting with other neurotransmitters or neuropeptides such as opioids, dopamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid and substance P in the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic regions. Studies on the role of glutamate and its receptors in opioid addiction will provide a new strategy for the exploitation of drugs for the treatment of opioid addiction. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

substance abuse","Dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS) is a relatively recently described iatrogenic disturbance that may complicate long-term symptomatic therapy of Parkinson's disease. Patients with DDS develop an addictive pattern of dopamine replacement therapy (DRT) use, administering doses in excess of those required to control their motor symptoms. The prevalence of DDS in patients attending specialist Parkinson's disease centres is 3-4%. Amongst the behavioural disturbances associated with DDS are punding, which is a complex stereotyped behaviour, and impulse control disorders (ICDs), such as pathological gambling, hypersexuality, compulsive shopping and compulsive eating. We review the risk factors and potential mechanisms for the development of DDS, including personality traits, potential genetic influences and Parkinson's disease-related cognitive deficits. Impulsive personality traits are prominent in patients developing DDS, and have been previously associated with the development of substance dependence. Candidate genes affecting the dopamine ""D2-like"" receptor family have been associated with impulsive personality traits in addition to drug and nondrug addictions. Impaired decision making is implicated in addictive behaviours, and decision-making abilities can be influenced by dopaminergic medications. In Parkinson's disease, disruption of the reciprocal loops between the striatum and structures in the prefrontal cortex following dopamine depletion may predispose to DDS. The role of DRT in DDS is discussed, with particular reference to models of addiction, suggesting that compulsive drug use is due to progressive neuroadaptations in dopamine projections to the accumbens-related circuitry. Evidence for neuroadaptations and sensitization occurring in DDS include enhanced levodopa-induced ventral striatal dopamine release. Levodopa is still considered the most potent trigger for DDS in Parkinson's disease, but subcutaneous apomorphine and oral dopamine agonists may also be responsible. In the management of DDS, further research is needed to identify at-risk groups, thereby facilitating more effective early intervention. Therefore, an increased awareness of the syndrome amongst treating physicians is vital. Medication reduction strategies are employed, particularly with regard to avoiding rapidly acting ""booster"" DRT formulations. Psychosocial treatments, including cognitive-behavioural therapy, have been beneficial in treating substance use disorders and ICDs in non-Parkinson's disease patients, but there are currently no published trials of psychological interventions in DDS. Further studies are also required to identify factors that can predict those patients with DDS or ICDs who will derive benefit from surgical interventions such as deep brain stimulation. © 2009 Adis Data Information BV.

ventral tegmentum","Among the basal ganglia nuclei, the subthalamic nucleus has a major function in the motor cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuit and is a target site for neurosurgical treatment such as parkinsonian patients with long-term motor fluctuations and dyskinesia. According to animal and human studies, the motor functions of the subthalamic nucleus have been well documented whereas its implication on limbic functions is still less well understood and is only partially explained by anatomical and functional theories of basal ganglia organisation. After chronic subthalamic nucleus stimulation in patients with Parkinson's disease, many studies showed executive impairments, apathy, depression, hypomania, and impairment of recognition of negative facial emotions. The medial tip of the subthalamic nucleus represents its limbic part. This part receives inputs from the anterior cingulate cortex, the medial prefrontal cortex, the limbic part of the striatum (nucleus accumbens), the ventral tegmental area and the limbic ventral pallidum. The medial tip of the subthalamic nucleus projects to the limbic part of the substantia nigra and the ventral tegmental area. We propose a new function scheme of the limbic system, establishing connections between limbic cortical structures (medial prefrontal cortex, amygdala and hippocampus) and the limbic part of the basal ganglia. This new circuit could be composed of a minor part based on the model of cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop, and of a major part linking the subthalamic nucleus with the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway via the ventral tegmental area and the nucleus accumbens, and with limbic cortical structures. This scheme could explain limbic impairments after subthalamic nucleus stimulation by disruption of limbic information inside the subthalamic nucleus and the ventral tegmental area. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

tobacco dependence / drug therapy","Crystal meth is a form of the stimulant drug methamphetamine that, when smoked, can rapidly achieve high concentrations in the brain. Methamphetamine causes the release of the neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin and activates the cardiovascular and central nervous systems. The levels of dopamine are low in the brain of some drug users, but whether this represents neuronal loss is uncertain. The areas of the brain involved in methamphetamine addiction are unknown but probably include the dopamine-rich striatum and regions that interact with the striatum. There is no medication approved for the treatment of relapses of methamphetamine addiction; however, potential therapeutic agents targeted to dopamine and non-dopamine (e.g., opioid) systems are in clinical testing. © 2008 Canadian Medical Association or its licensors.",CMAJ.

xerostomia / side effect","Background: Essential tremor (ET) is one of the most common tremor disorders in adults and is characterized by kinetic and postural tremor. To develop this practice parameter, the authors reviewed available evidence regarding initiation of pharmacologic and surgical therapies, duration of their effect, their relative benefits and risks, and the strength of evidence supporting their use. Method(s): A literature review using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, and CINAHL was performed to identify clinical trials in patients with ET published between 1966 and August 2004. Articles were classified according to a four-tiered level of evidence scheme and recommendations were based on the level of evidence. Results and Conclusion(s): Propranolol and primidone reduce limb tremor (Level A). Alprazolam, atenolol, gabapentin (monotherapy), sotalol, and topiramate are probably effective in reducing limb tremor (Level B). Limited studies suggest that propranolol reduces head tremor (Level B). Clonazepam, clozapine, nadolol, and nimodipine possibly reduce limb tremor (Level C). Botulinum toxin A may reduce hand tremor but is associated with dose-dependent hand weakness (Level C). Botulinurn toxin A may reduce head tremor (Level C) and voice tremor (Level C), but breathiness, hoarseness, and swallowing difficulties may occur in the treatment of voice tremor. Chronic deep brain stimulation (DBS) (Level C) and thalamotomy (Level C) are highly efficacious in reducing tremor. Each procedure carries a small risk of major complications. Some adverse events from DBS may resolve with time or with adjustment of stimulator settings. There is insufficient evidence regarding the surgical treatment of head and voice tremor and the use of gamma knife thalamotomy (Level U). Additional prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials are needed to better determine the efficacy and side effects of pharmacologic and surgical treatments of ET.

transcranial magnetic stimulation","Altered reward behavior in Parkinson's disease (PD) is supported by observations of a placebo effect, prevalence of addiction to dopamine agonists, incidence of compulsive reward-seeking behaviors, and disturbed affective symptoms in PD patients. However, it is not clear how dopamine neuron loss causes or supports these aberrant reward behaviors and alterations in affect. For example, striatal dopamine transporter loss has a small, significant relationship with depression and anxiety in mild/moderate PD, but not in severe PD. Also, dopamine loss itself does not appear to predict depression or anhedonia, the diminished capacity to experience pleasure. Other neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and depression may provide models of disturbed reward biology that may prove useful when thinking about altered reward circuitry and behavior in PD and other neurological disorders.

unspecified side effect / side effect","Anxiety disorders are one of the most frequent diseases in the clinical practice and represent a further risk factor for several internal diseases which they often coexist with. Stress is one of the most frequent causes of anxiety disorders. A typical stress response activates the hypothalamus - pituitary - adrenal axis (HPA) and increases the brain levels of cortisol, noradrenalin and serotonin, that stimulate several cortical, subcortical and limbic areas. In anxiety disorders there is an impairment of the negative feedback of HPA axis, a reduction of several serotonergic receptor subtypes, and an alteration of the serotonin synaptic transporter, probably genetically determined. A short-term treatment with benzodiazepines (BDZs) is the best option for the initial control of symptoms of anxiety disorders. The BDZs potentiate the inhibitory response of the GABA receptor complex, and this action reduces noradrenalin and serotonin release, in particular in the mesolimbic and mesocortical areas. Chronic treatment with BDZs is not recommended because of the onset of tolerance, addiction and withdrawal. Currently, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and serotonin and noradrenalin reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) are the first-line therapy for the long-term treatment of post-traumatic stress disorders. The therapeutic effect of SSRI and SNRI seems to be the result of presynaptic 5-HT1A down-regulation, increased synthesis of allopregnanolone and growth stimulation of new neurons. The adverse effects of SSRI and SNRI are most intense at beginning of the treatment, but they disappear rather swiftly. At the beginning of treatment it is useful to associate these drugs with BDZs, in order to improve the patient's compliance.",Acta Medica Mediterranea,2008

standard","Addiction or substance dependence is a psychiatric disorder that affects many individuals in the general population. Different theories concerning the neurobiological aspects of addiction have been proposed. Special attention has been paid to models concerning dysregulation of the reward circuit and the inhibitory control system within the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamocortical pathways. In the past, attempts have been made to treat patients suffering from addiction by performing psychosurgery. Lesions were created in specific brain regions that were believed to be dysfunctional in addiction. Procedures such as cingulotomy, hypothalamotomy, and resection of the substantia innominata and the nucleus accumbens have been described as a treatment for severe addictive disorders. Deep brain stimulation, a neurosurgical treatment that has been proven to be a safe alternative for lesions in the treatment of movement disorders, has more recently been proposed as treatments for severe psychiatric conditions such as treatment-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression. With the expanding knowledge of the neurobiology of addiction, deep brain stimulation could be a future option in the treatment arsenal of addiction.",Neurosurgical focus,2008

We report on a 54-year-old patient with a severe anxiety disorder and secondary depressive disorder in whom bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus accumbens was carried out. Despite the absence of desired improvement in his primary disorder, we observed a remarkable although not primarily intended alleviation of the patient's comorbid alcohol dependency. Our case report demonstrates the extremely effective treatment of alcohol dependency by means of DBS of the nucleus accumbens and may reveal new prospects in overcoming therapy resistance in dependencies in general.","Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry",Oct-07

withdrawal syndrome","Although addiction is a uniquely human phenomenon, some of its pathognomonic features can be modeled at the animal level. Such features include the euphoric ""high"" produced by acute administration of addictive drugs; the dysphoric ""crash"" produced by acute withdrawal; drug-seeking and drug-taking behaviors; and relapse to drug-seeking behavior after achieving successful abstinence. Animal models exist for each of these features. In this review, I focus on various animal models of addiction and how they can be used to search for clinically effective antiaddiction medications. I conclude by noting some of the new and novel medications that have been developed preclinically using such models and the hope for further developments along such lines. © Current Medicine Group LLC 2008.",Current Psychiatry Reports,2008

smoking cessation","The placebo effect has evolved from being thought of as a nuisance in clinical and pharmacological research to a biological phenomenon worthy of scientific investigation in its own right. It is now clear that the term placebo effect is too restrictive and, in fact, many placebo-related effects have recently been investigated. A placebo effect differs from a placebo-like effect in that the former follows the administration of a placebo, whereas in the latter no placebo is administered. However, in both cases, the psychosocial context around the treatment plays a key role. In recent years, placebo and placebo-related effects have been analyzed with sophisticated biological tools that have uncovered specific mechanisms at both the biochemical and cellular level. This recent research has revealed that these psychosocial-induced biochemical changes in a patient's brain and body in turn may affect the course of a disease and the response to a therapy.

Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale","OBJECTIVE: To describe how subthalamic deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) and reduction in dopamine replacement therapy (DRT) allowed rapid resolution of dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS) with severe behavioral disorder in a patient with late stage Parkinson disease (PD). BACKGROUND: DDS was recently defined as compulsive use of dopaminergic drugs, associated with severe behavioral symptoms, and impaired social functioning, occurring in about 4% of PD patients under DRT. STN-DBS is an effective treatment for late stage PD with treatment resistant motor fluctuations, which frequently allows also to reduce DRT. METHOD(S): A late stage PD patient referred to our center for STN-DBS, suffering from severe DDS necessitating in-ward psychiatric management, was comprehensively assessed preoperatively and postoperatively for motor, cognitive, and psychiatric status. RESULT(S): Following subthalamic DBS procedure and medication reduction, we observed a rapid and dramatic resolution of DDS and associated psychiatric symptoms, allowing discharge from a 2-year stay in a psychiatric institution. CONCLUSION(S): DDS occurring in late stage PD patients may be dramatically improved by STN-DBS, possibly in relation with the reduction of dopaminergic medication. In contrast to other psychiatric symptoms, DDS should not be considered as an obstacle to DBS procedure in late stage PD patients. © 2008 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Cognitive and Behavioral Neurology,Sep-08

subthalamic nucleus

ventral tegmentum","Dopamine replacement therapy in Parkinson's disease ameliorates motor symptoms. However, it has recently been recognized that a small subgroup of patients suffer motor and behavioral disturbances attributable to taking quantities of medication well beyond the dose required to treat their motor disabilities. Dopamine dysregulation syndrome can be regarded as a pattern of compulsive medication use leading to disabling motor and behavioral features. The major theories of psychostimulant addiction may help explain some of the phenomena seen in the dopamine dysregulation syndrome. In contrast to the predictable pattern of severe degeneration of ventrolateral nigral dopaminergic cells, there is a smaller and more variable loss of dopamine neurons within the ventral tegmental areas. Sensitization of ventral striatal networks to antiparkinsonian therapy and appetitive behaviors may be analogous to the neuroplastic changes in the dorsal striatum thought to contribute to the motor complications of treatment such as dyskinesias. This syndrome greatly affects patients, their families and society. Treatment is difficult; deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus may therefore prove useful in some cases. © 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.",Revue Neurologique,Apr-08

smoking","Awareness of cannabis dependence as a clinically relevant issue has grown in recent years. Clinical and laboratory studies demonstrate that chronic marijuana smokers can experience withdrawal symptoms upon cessation of marijuana smoking and have difficulty abstaining from marijuana use. This paper will review data implicating the cannabinoid CB1 receptor in regulating the behavioral effects of DELTA9-tetrahydrocannobinol (THC), the primary psychoactive component of cannabis, across a range of species. The behavioral effects that will be discussed include those that directly contribute to the maintenance of chronic marijuana smoking, such as reward, subjective effects, and the positive and negative reinforcing effects of marijuana, THC and synthetic cannabinoids. The role of the CB1 receptor in the development of marijuana dependence and expression of withdrawal will also be discussed. Lastly, treatment options that may alleviate withdrawal symptoms and promote marijuana abstinence will be considered. © 2008 The Authors.",Addiction Biology,Jun-08

A crucial process that can lead to relapse is exposure to stimuli that have been closely associated with alcohol consumption. Alcohol advertisements on television and on billboards, for example, are omni-present and may attract the attention of alcohol-dependent patients. Method(s): In several studies, abstinent alcohol-dependent patients and healthy controls were examined using functional magnetic resonance tomography and cue-reactivity paradigms with alcohol-related stimuli, including advertisements. Result(s): The results suggest altered brain activation in the so-called reward and attentional systems of alcohol-dependent patients, which is associated with alcohol craving and prospective risk of relapse. Conclusion(s): The results imply that alcohol-dependent patients are especially susceptible to alcohol-related advertisements.",Sucht,Oct-08

The present study was the first to use SPN as an index of the motivational significance of smoking-related pictures. Emotionally positive and neutral pictures served as controls. The paradigm involved the following sequence: (a) presentation of a picture (S1) for 500 ms, (b) a fixation cross for 3,500 ms, (c) a second presentation (S2) of the same picture for 2,000 ms, and (d) another fixation cross signifying the beginning of a new S1-S2 trial using a different picture. The participants (N = 24, half smokers and half nonsmokers) viewed pictures from three categories (smoking-related, emotionally positive, or emotionally neutral). Consistent with predictions, smokers exhibited significantly greater mean SPN amplitudes in anticipation of smoking-related pictures relative to neutral pictures. Among nonsmokers the SPN was significantly smaller in anticipation of smoking pictures compared with neutral pictures. These findings are consistent with the incentive sensitization theory of addiction and other conditioning and cue-reactivity models.",Nicotine and Tobacco Research,2008

We performed a randomized sham-controlled cross-over study in which 23 subjects received sham and active tDCS (anode left/cathode right and anode right/cathode left) of the DLPFC. Subjects were exposed to food and also watched a movie of food associated with strong craving. Desire for food consumption was evaluated by visual analogue scales (VAS) and food consumption before and after treatment. In addition we measured visual attention to food using an eye tracking system. Craving for viewed foods as indexed by VAS was reduced by anode right/cathode left tDCS. After sham stimulation, exposure to real food or food-related movie increased craving; whereas after anode left/cathode right tDCS, the food-related stimuli did not increase craving levels, as revealed by the VAS scale. Moreover, compared with sham stimulation, subjects fixated food-related pictures less frequently after anode right/cathode left tDCS and consumed less food after both active stimulation conditions. These changes were not related to mood changes after any type of tDCS treatment. The effects of tDCS on food craving might be related to a modulation of neural circuits associated with reward and decision-making. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Appetite,Jul-08

treatment outcome","Pathological gambling (PG) is defined by the DSM IV criteria as inappropriate, persistent, and maladaptive gambling behavior that has repercussions on family, personal, and professional life. It is classified as an impulse control disorder and is widely understood as a nonpharmacological addiction. PG has been reported as a complication in the treatment of Parkinson disease (PD). The prevalence of PG in PD has been reported to range between 1.7 and 7% compared to a prevalence of approximately 1% in the general population. Though there is no survey that indicates the prevalence of PG in Japanese PD patients, problematic gambling behaviors in PD are occasionally observed. In addition to PG other impulse control behaviors and punding (repetitive stereotyped behavior) are recognized as components of the dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS), which is characterized by the compulsive use of dopaminergic medications, including levodopa and subcutaneous apomorphine. Though PG can occur with DDS it often occurs in isolation. The vast majority of PG seen in PD is related to dopamine agonists (DA). With regard to the administration of oral DA, pramipexole may induce a higher degree of PG than other types of oral DA due to its disproportionate stimulation of dopamine D3 receptors. However, the differences between the observed effects of various classes of oral DA were insignificant. PG associated with levodopa mono-therapy is uncommon, but in the majority of cases levodopa is co-prescribed. Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) was recently introduced to treat advanced PD. An improvement in PG symptoms following STN-DBS has been reported due to a marked decrease in dopaminergic medications. However, in some patients, PG developed following STN-DBS despite the significant reduction or discontinuation of DA. STN-DBS per se may be a potential initiator of PG. Younger age of PD onset, novelty seeking personality traits, history of alcohol abuse, and impulsivity traits were significant predictors of PG. Patients especially those with individual susceptibility to PG should be warned of the potential risks of PG before DA treatment is initiated.",Brain and Nerve,Sep-08

Successful treatments of small samples suffering from dystonia, cluster headache or Tourette's Syndrome or from obessive-compulsive disorders and depression make a future extension of indication seem probable. In this context the efficiency of DBS for the treatment of addiction is being discussed. Aim and Methods: To assess the potential effects of DBS of different target areas on addiction a keyword-related research in Pubmed (National Library of Medicine, Washington) was undertaken and own research was integrated. Finding(s): Only case reports and case series were being found, describing in total n = 28 patients. Dopamine replacement therapy dependence (DRTD) and pathological gambling (PG) were reported in conjunction with DBS of the nucleus subthalamicus (STN). Addiction to alcohol, nicotine and heroin were reported in conjunction with DBS of the nucleus accumbens (NAc). These findings were collected in a spreadsheet and discussed. Conclusion(s): For STN DBS remissions of PG and DRTD are only reported during the underlying treatment of Parkinson's disease. As method of action therefore the reduction of Parkinsonian medication seems more probable. For NAc DBS remissions of addiction to alcohol, nicotine and heroin are reported during the underlying treatment of heterogonous psychiatric disorders. In contrast to STN DBS this refers to possible, maybe supportive effects of NAc DBS. The exact methods of action are not well understood, but an high motivation of the patients to stay abstinent seems to be of relevance for the effect of NAc DBS. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.",Fortschritte der Neurologie Psychiatrie,Jul-08

Eleven cannabis users and 16 comparison subjects were scanned during right (RFT) and left (LFT) finger-tapping tasks on a GE 1.5 Tesla scanner retrofitted with a whole body echo planar coil. Image analyses were conducted in SPM99 using an ROI approach to define each Brodmann area (BA). Differences in cerebral activation were examined in the left and right primary motor cortex (BA4), SMA (BA6), and ACC (BA24 and BA32 separately). The authors found diminished activation for contralateral BA6 from Day 0 to Day 28. For LFT, the authors also found: ipsilaterally diminished BA6 activation on Day 7, but not Day 0 or Day 28; ipsilaterally diminished BA32 activation on Day 0, but not Day 7 or Day 28; contralaterally diminished BA 4 activation on Day 28, but not Day 0 or Day 7; and contralaterally diminished BA32 activation on Day 0 and Day 28, but not Day 7. For RFT, the authors found ipsilaterally diminished BA32 activation on Days 0 and 7 but not on Day 28; contralaterally diminished BA32 activation on Days 0, 7, and 28; and ipsilaterally diminished BA6 activation on Days 0, 7, and 28. These results suggest that residual diminished brain activation is still observed after discontinuing cannabis use in motor cortical circuits. © 2008 American Psychological Association.",Experimental and Clinical Psychopharmacology,Feb-08

substance abuse","Several studies show that substance dependence disorders are characterized by an enhanced processing of substance-related stimuli. The present study was designed to examine the association between craving levels and selective processing of drug cues in cocaine-dependent patients using event-related brain potentials (ERPs). In abstinent cocaine-dependent patients and a healthy control group, we studied the late positive potential (LPP) amplitudes elicited by neutral and cocaine-related stimuli. The results show that cocaine-dependent patients have an enhanced electrophysiological response in the late LPP time window to cocaine-related stimuli as compared to controls, suggesting an enhanced processing of these stimuli. Most importantly, a robust association was observed between cocaine craving and LPP amplitude. High craving levels were associated with larger LPP amplitudes at central electrode sites in the right hemisphere. These findings are in line with theories linking motivational aspects and appetitive stimulus processing. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that ERPs are a useful index to assess motivational properties of stimuli in cocaine-dependent patients. These findings suggest that electrophysiological measures may have clinical relevance in substance use disorders. © 2008 The Authors.",Addiction Biology,Sep-08

Pain in the elderly population is especially difficult given the myriad of physiological, pharmacological, and psychological aspects of caring for the geriatric patient. Opiates are the mainstay of pain treatment throughout all age groups but special attention must be paid to the efficacy and side effects of these powerful drugs when prescribing to a population with impaired metabolism, excretion and physical reserve. In a random chart review of 300 US veterans, 44% of those receiving an analgesic also received opioids. The increasing use of opiates for pain management by healthcare practitioners requires that those prescribing opioids be aware of the special considerations for treating the elderly. This article will address the precautions one must take when using opiates in the geriatric population, as well as the side effects and ways to minimize them. © 2008 Dove Medical Press Limited.

vagus nerve stimulation","Basic scientific advances in understanding the neuropsychobiology of bipolar disorder have given us a multitude of opportunities to explore and exploit new avenues of therapeutics. Pharmacotherapeutic approaches include: neuropeptides (agonists such as thyrotropin-releasing hormone and antagonists such as corticotropin-releasing hormone), neurotrophic factors (especially brain-derived neurotrophic factor), and glutamatergic mechanisms (such as riluzole, ketamine, and antagonists of the NR-2B subunit of the glutamate receptor). Physiological interventions that would offer alternatives to electroconvulsive therapy include: repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation, especially at more intense stimulation parameters; magnetic stimulation therapy (seizures induced more focally by magnetic rather than electrical stimulation with resulting reduced meaning loss); vagal nerve stimulation, and deep brain stimulation. However, these, as well as the panoply of existing treatments, require further intensive investigation to place each of them in the proper therapeutic sequence and combination for the individual patient, based on development of better clinical and biological predictors of response. Large clinical trial networks and development of systematic research in clinical practice settings, such as that featured by the National Cancer Institute for cancer chemotherapy, would greatly accelerate the progress in incorporating new, as well as existing, agents into the best treatment strategies. The bipolar disorders, which are increasingly recognized as complex, highly comorbid conditions with a high morbidity and mortality, of which the majority start in childhood and adolescence, are not likely to respond completely to any single new treatment agent, and new public health initiatives and research strategies are needed as much as any new single treatment advance. © 2008, LLS SAS.",Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience,2008

review","Food, drugs and brain stimulation can serve as strong rewarding stimuli and are all believed to activate common brain circuits that evolved in mammals to favour fitness and survival. For decades, endogenous dopaminergic and opioid systems have been considered the most important systems in mediating brain reward processes. Recent evidence suggests that the endogenous cannabinoid (endocannabinoid) system also has an important role in signalling of rewarding events. First, CB1 receptors are found in brain areas involved in reward processes, such as the dopaminergic mesolimbic system. Second, activation of CB1 receptors by plant-derived, synthetic or endogenous CB 1 receptor agonists stimulates dopaminergic neurotransmission, produces rewarding effects and increases rewarding effects of abused drugs and food. Third, pharmacological or genetic blockade of CB1 receptors prevents activation of dopaminergic neurotransmission by several addictive drugs and reduces rewarding effects of food and these drugs. Fourth, brain levels of the endocannabinoids anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol are altered by activation of reward processes. However, the intrinsic activity of the endocannabinoid system does not appear to play a facilitatory role in brain stimulation reward and some evidence suggests it may even oppose it. The influence of the endocannabinoid system on brain reward processes may depend on the degree of activation of the different brain areas involved and might represent a mechanism for fine-tuning dopaminergic activity. Although involvement of the various components of the endocannabinoid system may differ depending on the type of rewarding event investigated, this system appears to play a major role in modulating reward processes. © 2008 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.",British Journal of Pharmacology,May-08

Since the publication of the first version of this guideline, a substantial number of new randomized controlled studies of anxiolytics have been published. In particular, more relapse prevention studies are now available that show sustained efficacy of anxiolytic drugs. The recommendations, developed by the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) Task Force for the Pharmacological Treatment of Anxiety, Obsessive-Compulsive and Post-traumatic Stress Disorders, a consensus panel of 30 international experts, are now based on 510 published randomized, placebo- or comparator-controlled clinical studies (RCTs) and 130 open studies and case reports. First-line treatments for these disorders are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and the calcium channel modulator pregabalin. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are equally effective for some disorders, but many are less well tolerated than the SSRIs/SNRIs. In treatment-resistant cases, benzodiazepines may be used when the patient does not have a history of substance abuse disorders. Potential treatment options for patients unresponsive to standard treatments are described in this overview. Although these guidelines focus on medications, non-pharmacological were also considered. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and other variants of behaviour therapy have been sufficiently investigated in controlled studies in patients with anxiety disorders, OCD, and PTSD to support them being recommended either alone or in combination with the above medicines.",World Journal of Biological Psychiatry,2008

Positron emission tomography (PET) showed activation of specific brain structures, brainstem in migraine and hypothalamic grey in trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias. This brain activation suggests it may intervene both in a permissive or triggering manner and as a response to pain driven by the first division of the trigeminal nerve. Voxel-based morphometry has suggested that there is a correlation between the brain area activated specifically in acute cluster headache - the posterior hypothalamic grey matter - and an increase in grey matter in the same region. New insights into mechanisms of head pain have emerged thanks to neuroimaging obtained in experimentally induced headaches, and during peripheral and central neurostimulation. © Springer-VerlagItalia 2007.",Neurological Sciences,May-07

Absinthe liquor with thujone was forbidden in most European countries because it was taken in abuse. Up to now there have been a lot of theories about the mechanism of the pharmacological effect on the central nervous system. New researches verify an interaction of thujone with GABA-receptors. Within the process of adapting the EU-law the absinthe liquor is allowed again and is not classified as dangerous when taken as directed, as the content of thujone should not exceed the particular limits depending on content of alcohol in the liquor.",Medizinische Monatsschrift fur Pharmazeuten,Sep-07

This review article focuses on data showing that the interaction among stress, ethanol, and neuroactive steroids may result in plastic molecular and functional changes of GABAergic inhibitory neurotransmission. The molecular mechanisms by which stress-ethanol-neuroactive steroids interactions can produce plastic changes in GABAA receptors have been studied using different experimental models in vivo and in vitro in order to provide useful evidence and new insights into the mechanisms through which acute and chronic ethanol and stress exposure modulate the activity of GABAergic synapses. We show detailed data on a) the effect of acute and chronic stress on peripheral and brain neurosteroid levels and GABAA receptor gene expression and function; b) ethanol-stimulated brain steroidogenesis; c) plasticity of GABAA receptor after acute and chronic ethanol exposure. The implications of these new mechanistic insights to our understanding of the effects of ethanol during stress are also discussed. The understanding of these neurochemical and molecular mechanisms may shed new light on the physiopathology of diseases, such as anxiety, in which GABAergic transmission plays a pivotal role. These data may also lead to the need for new anxiolytic, hypnotic and anticonvulsant selective drugs devoid of side effects. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

treatment response","We describe two patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) who developed clinical criteria of pathological gambling addiction in the setting of increased dopamine replacement therapy (levodopa and dopamine agonist medications). The second patient showed also signs of dopamine dysregulation syndrome, with an addiction to dopaminergic medication. Neither patients responded to the standard therapy for gambling behavior, but dramatically improved after bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) and early postoperative withdrawal of dopaminergic therapy. The possible therapeutic role of subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) on such a disabling behavior needs to be investigated prospectively. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Neural responses to cocaine cues and acute stress were investigated in an fMRI study. Ten male participants mentally reenacted personalized scripts about cocaine use and a neutral experience both with and without a stressor present (anticipation of electrical shock). Interaction analysis between script type and stress condition revealed greater activation of the posterior cingulate cortex and of the parietal lobe during the cocaine script in the presence of the stressor. These data suggest that stress may precipitate relapse in cocaine addiction by activating brain areas that mediate reward processing and the attentional and mnemonic bias for drug use reminders.

Previous studies evaluated higher cognitive functions such as working memory, but basic sensory information processing circuits have never been investigated before. Therefore, we applied a simple visual and acoustic stimulation paradigm in this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) pilot study. Nine recently detoxified male alcohol-dependent patients and nine healthy volunteers were presented a well-established 6-Hz checkerboard and auditory stimuli in the form of drumbeats in a block-design fMRI paradigm. During visual and acoustic stimulation, alcoholics and controls activated widespread occipital and temporal brain areas, as well as parts of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and thalamus. In a comparison of the stimulation-induced activation of alcoholics and controls, the alcoholics showed a significantly lower blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal in an extended bilateral occipital area (P < 0.001) as compared with healthy controls. In no region was the BOLD signal significantly higher in the alcohol-dependent subjects compared with controls. The reason for the new finding of a highly significant lower activation of the occipital cortex is unclear. It is in line with studies of neuropsychological tests in recently detoxified alcohol-dependent patients that also reported deficits in visual abilities. Attention deficits or a persisting neuronal alteration in the first weeks of alcohol abstinence may have contributed to this result. © 2006 The Authors.",Addiction Biology,Mar-07

Patient(s): Twenty-one patients with idiopathic PD with PG after the patients began receiving medications compared with a consecutive sample of 42 patients with idiopathic PD without compulsive behaviors. Main Outcome Measure(s): Clinical features, comorbid psychiatric and substance use disorders, personality traits, and impulsivity scores. Result(s): Patients with PG had a younger age at PD onset (P=.006), higher novelty seeking (P<.001), medication-induced hypomania or mania (P=.001), impaired planning (P=.002), or a personal or immediate family history of alcohol use disorders (P=.002). Novelty seeking, a personal or immediate family history of alcohol use disorders, and younger age at PD onset accurately predicted PG at 83.7% in a logistic regression model, with the model accounting for 62% of the variance. Conclusion(s): Patients with PD having a younger age at PD onset, higher novelty seeking traits, and a personal or family history of alcohol use disorders may have a greater risk for PG with dopamine agonists. ©2007 American Medical Association.

Research on the neural organization and functions of the dorsal striatum in movement disorders, such as Huntington's and Parkinson's Disease, can inform the study of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in motivational disorders, such as addiction and depression. We propose opposing roles for dopamine (DA) and acetylcholine (ACh) in the NAc in the control of GABA output systems for approach and avoidance. Contrary to DA, which fosters approach, ACh release is a correlate or cause of meal satiation, conditioned taste aversion and aversive brain stimulation. ACh may also counteract excessive DA-mediated approach behavior as revealed during withdrawal from drugs of abuse or sugar when the animal enters an ACh-mediated state of anxiety and behavioral depression. This review summarizes evidence that ACh is important in the inhibition of behavior when extracellular DA is high and the generation of an anxious or depressed state when DA is relatively low. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

self concept","After an initial discussion of dream stimulation experiments, the author explains the special attraction of movies as resulting from the interplay of three factors. In technical terms, Maltese cross and wing shutter produce an interruption of the natural perception process, causing an inner vacuum and occasioning a state of affective arousal, independently of the actual content of the film in question. Together with the ambiance of the cinema itself, they thus create intrapsychic conditions resulting in a specific film-ego state. This is similar to the state of the ego when falling asleep and describable in terms of regressive changes of the ego's structures and functions, coupled with largely physical processes of perception and predominantly shaped by early mother-child-interaction-forms. As in the pre-sleep stage, the film-ego >>un-differentiates<< itself as self-representations begin to merge with a world of early object representations, thus reviving perception modes associated with breastfeeding organization in early infancy. Accordingly, the movie spectator displays a synesthetic receptiveness that differs from the clearly conscious type of perception otherwise related to the outside world. In this state, moving pictures are largely perceived in the medium of a more strongly cathected body-ego. Owing to this ego regression, moving pictures can be charged with fantasies stemming from the primal scene complex. These give the content of the given movie an aura, or latent substance, which gives it its specific power to affect us. As in dreams, the manifest >>plot<< of the film conceals this latency, which, as an un-dealt-with stimulus, then further exacerbates the addiction to moving pictures. Accordingly, this addiction originates from the (mechanical) liberation from the need to deal with un-dealt-with residues. It is in fact a longing to regain the primary unity of the breastfeeding situation, the desire to find a satisfactory solution for the primal scene fantasy and to do this with the aid of pictures systematically devised by film-makers for the purpose. Unlike dreams and daydreams, these pictures spare us the psychic effort involved in the active construction of the manifest.",Psyche,Dec-07

Nicotine induces tolerance and addiction by acting on the central dopaminergic pathways, thus leading to pleasure and reward sensations within the limbic system. It stimulates the central nervous system (CNS), enhances alertness and reduces the appetite. A 50% reduction of nicotine consumption may trigger withdrawal symptoms in addicted individuals: anxiety, anger, sleep disorders, hunger, cognitive dysfunction and cigarette craving. Medical advice is the cornerstone of smoking cessation. Pharmacotherapy of nicotine addiction comprises first-line (bupropion and nicotine replacement therapy) and second-line (clonidine and nortriptyline) drugs. Bupropion is a non-tricyclic antidepressant that inhibits dopamine uptake, whose contraindications are: epilepsy, eating disorders, uncontrolled hypertension, recent alcohol abstinence and current therapy with MAO inhibitors. Nicotine replacement therapy can be done with patches or gums. Counseling groups and behavioral interventions are efficacious. The effects of acupuncture on smoking cessation are not fully elucidated. Prompt smoking cessation or gradual reduction strategies have similar success rates.",Revista Brasileira de Otorrinolaringologia,2005

visual hallucination / drug therapy","Introduction and development. Subthalamic stimulation is a therapeutic option that can be used to treat advanced cases of Parkinson's disease. However, psychiatric or cognitive disorders have been reported in some patients treated using this technique. Age and a long disease history are two important risk factors for the appearance of these problems. The complications that have been reported include cases of depression, apathy, manias and psychosis. Surgery can also exacerbate the syndrome of addiction to levodopa that is sometimes observed. In contrast, sleep disorders usually improve with this technique. As far as the cognitive sphere is concerned, verbal fluency has been seen to deteriorate and the executive functions become impaired in patients over 69 years of age. These disorders are usually due to a number of different causes and have been attributed to the action of stimulating areas close to the subthalamic nucleus, to the presence of previously existing cognitive or psychiatric problems, to unrealistic expectations about this technique or to the individual's inability to adapt to the functional situation after surgery. Conclusions. Although generally speaking these disorders are not usually serious, they must be borne in mind so that adequate treatment can be indicated. © 2006, Revista de Neurologia.",Revista de Neurologia,Aug-06

transcranial magnetic stimulation","Decisions require careful weighing of the risks and benefits associated with a choice. Some people need to be offered large rewards to balance even minimal risks, whereas others take great risks in the hope for an only minimal benefit. We show here that risk-taking is a modifiable behavior that depends on right hemisphere prefrontal activity. We used low-frequency, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation to transiently disrupt left or right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) function before applying a well known gambling paradigm that provides a measure of decision-making under risk. Individuals displayed significantly riskier decision-making after disruption of the right, but not the left, DLPFC. Our findings suggest that the right DLPFC plays a crucial role in the suppression of superficially seductive options. This confirms the asymmetric role of the prefrontal cortex in decision-making and reveals that this fundamental human capacity can be manipulated in normal subjects through cortical stimulation. The ability to modify risk-taking behavior may be translated into therapeutic interventions for disorders such as drug abuse or pathological gambling.

withdrawal syndrome / complication / drug therapy / prevention","Smoking remains the leading cause of preventable death worldwide. Despite the development of a number of drugs for smoking cessation, overall efficacy of these substances is limited and the majority of smokers fail to quit smoking longterm. These drugs aim to help people quit by either replacing nicotine with an alternative source of nicotine (eg, patches or gums) or by reducing the withdrawal symptoms. A vaccine against nicotine has a different strategy: by inducing sufficient nicotine-specific antibodies, it is possible to sequester the drug in the blood and prevent it from entering the brain. In this way, the addictive properties of cigarettes are eliminated and smokers attempting to quit may be able to smoke one or two cigarettes without becoming hooked again. Essentially, a vaccine against nicotine targets the progression from lapses to full relapse rather than withdrawal symptoms. Recent research with vaccines against nicotine has clearly demonstrated in animals that antibodies can interfere with the addictive properties of nicotine in different settings. The first phase II clinical trial has confirmed the validity of the concept and shown that a vaccine against nicotine can be efficacious for smoking cessation in humans provided anti-nicotine antibody levels are sufficiently high. © The Thomson Corporation.",Current Opinion in Molecular Therapeutics,Feb-06

Twenty-seven abstinent cocaine-dependent individuals took part in script-guided stress imagery in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study. Regional brain activation during stress imagery was compared with a baseline period, for male and female participants separately. Their California Psychological Inventory socialization scores were then correlated in region of interest analysis with corticolimbic brain regions that showed significant activation during stress. The effect size of activity change in the medial prefrontal cortex is associated with lower socialization score (i.e. greater sociopathy) and with the change in heart rate, but only among female participants. These results highlight important sex differences in the association between antisocial personality and distress processing in cocaine-dependent individuals. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",NeuroReport,Feb-06

tobacco dependence","Background: Young adults who use stimulants (e.g., cocaine, amphetamines) are at particular risk of transitioning to dependence. Previously, we demonstrated increased risk-taking in young adults who had used stimulants (Leland, D.S., Paulus, M.P., 2005. Increased risk-taking decision-making but not altered response to punishment in stimulant-using young adults. Drug. Alcohol Depend. 78, 83-90). Since outcome uncertainty is a critical element of risk, we investigated whether such individuals have different neural responses to uncertainty than their stimulant-naive peers. Method(s): Eleven young adults (age 18-25) who had used stimulants were compared with 11 age- and education-matched stimulant-naive controls using functional magnetic resonance imaging and a card prediction task with relatively certain/uncertain outcome conditions. Result(s): The caudate, an area involved in processing salient events, was among those regions more active in users than controls in response to uncertainty. Personality measures revealed that users were more impulsive than controls, and that neural response to uncertainty in a number of areas, including the thalamus/caudate, was positively correlated with impulsivity. Conclusion(s): These results are consistent with the idea that young adults who have used stimulants find uncertainty particularly salient, due in part to preexisting differences in impulsivity, and may be subject to more ""action pressure"" when making decisions under uncertainty. This neural and personality profile may constitute a marker for increased risk of stimulant use. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",NeuroImage,01-Nov-06

ventral tegmentum","Recent studies have shown that the endocannabinoid system is involved in the common neurobiological mechanism underlying drug addiction. This system participates in the primary rewarding effects of cannabinoids, nicotine, alcohol and opioids, through the release of endocannabinoids in the ventral tegmental area. Endocannabinoids are also involved in the motivation to seek drugs by a dopamine-independent mechanism, demonstrated for psychostimulants and opioids. The endocannabinoid system also participates in the common mechanisms underlying relapse to drug-seeking behaviour by mediating the motivational effects of drug-related environmental stimuli and drug re-exposure. In agreement, clinical trials have suggested that the CB1 cannabinoid antagonist rimonabant can cause smoking cessation. Thus, CB1 cannabinoid antagonists could represent a new generation of compounds to treat drug addiction. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Trends in Neurosciences,Apr-06

surgical technique","DBS procedures for movement disorders, particularly PD, ET, and primary dystonia, have become established therapeutic options because of their safety and efficacy. Patient selection is of utmost concern, however, because of the inherent risks of stereotactic procedures and the relationship between response and presurgical motor and cognitive status. For PD, the most reliable indicator of response to surgery is the extent of improvement in response to levodopa, which is matched but not outperformed by any surgical treatment. Eligibility criteria in current use limit the surgical treatment to about 2% of all patients. These criteria intend to maximize the motor benefits and restrict the potential procedure-related and disease-specific complications. Only a few randomized controlled clinical trials are available comparing the benefits of the two major surgical targets for PD (STN and GPi), but each affords significant improvement compared with the baseline function. STN DBS also allows for dopaminergic dose reduction. The need for time-intensive postoperative DBS programming must be considered when deciding in favor of this therapeutic modality given the active involvement required of patients. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

vagus nerve stimulation","Several epidemiological studies confirmed that Anxiety Disorders as a group are the most prevalent psychiatric conditions in the United States. The importance of these conditions is underlined by the fact that they cause significant disability, poor quality of life, alcohol and drug abuse. Anxiety disorders are treatable conditions and respond to the front-line interventions such as serotonin reuptake inhibitors and cognitive behavioral therapy. However, only about 60% of patients respond to those treatments to any significant degree. Many still have residual symptoms or stay treatment refractory. The group of anxiety patients that is resistant to the treatment has been shown to have very poor quality of life and have highest rate of suicidal attempts than any other disorders. Many biological, treatment specific and social factors are affecting treatment resistance. In this paper, we are attempting to review reasons for the treatment resistance. In addition, we would like to review current strategies that could be helpful in reducing treatment resistance and aiding people chronically suffering from these severe and disabling conditions. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.",Molecular Psychiatry,Sep-06

world health organization","Brain disease psychiatric and neurologic disease combined represents a considerable social and economic burden in Europe. Data collected by the World Health Organization (WHO) suggest that brain diseases are responsible for 35% of Europe's told disease burden. An analysis of all health economic studies of brain diseases in Europe, published by the European Brain Council (EBC) in June 2005, estimated the total cost of brain disease in Europe in 2004 to be 386 billion. That burden is set to grow, mainly due to the fact that the European population is ageing. Investment in brain sciences does not match that burden now, let alone in the future. Brain research received only 8% of the life science budget in the European Commission's Fifth Framework Programme, which represents less than 0.01% of the annual cost of brain disorders for that period. Over the bst decade, Europe has been losing ground to the USA and Japan in terms or both basic and clinical research. Many of Europe's young researchers are taking up posts in the USA and staying there. Big pharmaceutical companies are fleeing Europe for the USA, taking their drug development programmes with them. Research in the brain sciences now holds the promise of therapies that halt and even reverse neurodegeneration, of better diagnostic tools, neural prostheses for the paralysed and drugs for depression and anxiety that are tailored to the individual, thereby eliminating or reducing side effects. Our growing understanding of the normal brain could lead to better prevention of brain disease and to more effective teaching methods. The need for innovative treatments has never been greater, and Europe boasts clusters of excellent researchers in biotechnology who could collaborate with brain scientists and the pharmaceutical industry to realise this promise. But if Europe is to seize these opportunities and meet the challenge of brain disease, it needs to go forward on the basis of greater collaboration between countries, greater collaboration between industry, academia and patient organisations, and increased investment in the brain sciences. The EBC was formed in 2002 to bring together scientists, clinicians, the pharmaceutical industry, charities and patient organisations from all over Europe to campaign for these goals. It takes a novel, bottom-up approach to research policy, and in developing this consensus document, it aims to promote a greater and more focused effort in this area, to improve public understanding of the brain sciences and above all, to support brain research as a priority under the European Commission's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7, 2007-2013). The research programme outlined here was first conceived by the EBC board. An outline was sent to all member organisations and a number of individual experts for comments. Following that, a table of contents was developed. The 45 research themes were written by groups of experts from across Europe who represent a wide range of disciplines. Each one contains a proposal for future research on a specific brain-related theme which the EBC believes could form the basis of one or more integrated projects or strategic targeted research projects (STREP) funded under FP7. The EBC has deliberately focused on the major diseases and then described the basic research needed to understand and treat or perhaps even cure those diseases. The programme is therefore constructed ""from man to molecule"" and not the other way round, with equal importance attached to basic and clinical research. The EBC suggests that each of the proposed integrated projects or STREP should be awarded a budget in the order of 10 to 15 million. In addition, brain research should be treated as an important element of many other parts of FP7, such as the European Research Council and research programmes on information technology and the causes of violence. Any research programme that concerns human behaviour should, by definition, take account of brain research. The EBC envisages that the priority for brain research it proposes at the European level will translate into higher priority for brain research at the national level, and this document may also serve as a starting point for the development of national consensus programmes. It seems likely that consensus conferences on brain research in Europe may further develop the themes and ideas discussed here. An EBC task force may also be established to further the consensus process. In general, increasing funding in the brain sciences would bring enormous economic returns by lightening the burden on healthcare systems and increasing the productivity of affected individuals-and might easily pay for itself. The human and social returns of such an investment are inestimable. And the time to act is now.","Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry",Aug-06

Objective(s): To review published articles on the assessment, diagnosis and treatment of pain following spinal cord injury (SCI) and to synthesise evidence from these materials to formulate and propose a systematic approach to management. Method(s): Relevant articles regarding the treatment of pain were identified from electronic databases using the search terms (('spinal cord injury' or 'spinal cord injuries') and 'pain') and both ('treatment') and ('randomised controlled trials'). Relevant articles were also identified through citations in indexed journal publications and book chapters on this topic. Result(s): Review of the literature indicates that there are a large variety of treatments used in the management of pain following SCI with a small number supported by strong evidence for effectiveness. A treatment algorithm is proposed based on identification of underlying pain contributors and application of appropriate treatment. Conclusion(s): Although there are relatively few studies clearly indicating efficacy in this population, an algorithm for the management of pain following SCI might assist to maximise our effectiveness in the treatment of this condition. It is recognised that choice of treatment is also determined by factors such as medication availability, cost and side effects as well as the preferences and characteristics of the person being treated. Nevertheless, an algorithm is proposed as a way to synthesise our current level of knowledge, identify gaps for further study and aid in the management of this difficult problem. © 2006 International Spinal Cord Society All rights reserved.",Spinal Cord,Feb-06

review","Cocaine is a drug of abuse that has complex neurochemical and behavioural profiles. When it became evident that models that involve only dopamine do not fully explain the complex effects of cocaine on behaviour, the focus of research expanded to include the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) system in the brain. The 5-HT system comprises several subtypes of 5-HT receptors, which contribute differentially to the various behavioural effects of cocaine. In this article, we describe which subtypes regulate behaviours that are related to cocaine addiction and how they might provide new therapeutic approaches. Numerous subpopulations of each 5-HT receptor can be distinguished according to their location in the brain. We also discuss how these subpopulations relate to the effects of 5-HT-receptor stimulation at the systemic level. These insights provide a new receptor-based approach for understanding the 5-HT mechanisms that subserve the actions of cocaine and possible pharmacotherapies against cocaine addiction. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

*voluntary movement","Neuronal oscillatory firing patterns are widely thought to serve as coincidence detectors, so as to synchronize information processing across brain regions. I hypothesize here that, instead, oscillatory function can be better understood by reversing conventional models and regarding oscillations slower than 30 Hz as background activity occurring in the absence of conscious or voluntary function. Action potentials occurring out of phase with the local population oscillation then emerge as information carriers, according to a prediction error mechanism that was first described in the drug abuse literature. Shannon information calculations show that coding by out-of-phase action potentials is far more efficient than are conventional synchronization models, and a simple calculation of the degree to which an action potential is out of phase correctly predicts the amount of information content. This model appears to account for a wide range of existing experimental observations of visual attention, voluntary motor function, and movement disorders. It also suggests an intuitively simple way of understanding consciousness, based upon a ""self-observing"" feedback mechanism of neocortical neurons firing out of phase. The hypothesis also suggests that the function of slow-wave sleep may be to re-entrain desynchronized oscillations. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Medical Hypotheses,2006

Advances in functional brain imaging techniques make it possible to directly investigate this special mental state in vivo and non-invasively. Extant imaging studies on craving have been mostly on cocaine which is the dominant drug abused in the U.S. Employing functional MRI, we examined substance specificity of the neural circuitry underlying craving for heroin. Heroin is the primary drug abused in south-east Asia and has, particularly, become a serious social problem for China in recent years. Following abstinence from water and drug, 14 active heroin addicts (all male, mean age 33.2 years, average drug use history 7.1 years) underwent scanning inside a 1.5T Philips MR scanner during exposure to water-related, drug-related, and neutral cues. Water-related cues elicited anterior cingulate activation (Brodmann's area BA 32/24). Drug-related cues activated bilateral inferior frontal cortex (BA 44/45), confirming the critical role of prefrontal cortex in drug craving. Results suggest heroin craving may involve different neural substrates than do desire from basic physiological drives, such as thirst. As the first fMRI study of heroin craving, our study adds to the scant but much-needed brain imaging literature on heroin addiction. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Long-lasting long-term potentiation is also a cellular model used in the research of long-term memory. The transformation from silent synapses to the functional ones is probably the important mechanism for the LTP maintenance. After induction, the LTP could be reversed by the physiological or artificial stimulations. Owing to the reversibility of LTP and its input-specific characteristics, it is reasonable to interfere specifically the addiction memory with particular deep brain electrical stimulation without damaging the brain functions.",Journal of Xi'an Jiaotong University (Medical Sciences),2005

*striate cortex","Converging evidence indicates that repeated exposure to motor stimulants such as cocaine and amphetamine produces marked alterations in network responsiveness of striatal neurons to subsequent challenge with the same stimulant drug. Such alterations, which correlate with persistent patterns of repetitive behavior, associate with distinct compartmental changes in the neostriatum. Striatal matrix system neurons undergo ""silencing"" following repeated drug challenges, allowing striosome system neurons to exhibit preferential activation. Matrix neurons are innervated by sensory and motor areas of neocortex and are activated in the course of on-going, adaptive behavior. Inactivation of matrix neurons by chronic stimulant exposure may therefore constrain sensorimotor and cognitive processing. In turn, the striosomes are anatomically connected through re-entrant loops with limbic prefrontal and allocortical structures, such as anterior cingulate cortex, orbital frontal cortex, and basolateral amygdala, all of which play a part in stimulant-induced reinforcement and relapse to drug-taking. Moreover, functional evidence links striosome system neurons, which are responsible for providing inhibitory regulatory feedback to midbrain dopamine neurons, with reinforcement-based processes. In considering such evidence, we postulate that recurrent matrix inactivation and recruitment of striosome-based pathways by chronic stimulant exposure represent neural end-points of the transit from action-outcome associative behavior to conditioned habitual responding. Within this theoretical framework, habitual behavior can be elicited by both interoceptive cues and exteroceptive conditioned stimuli to promote the automatic execution of learned responses. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The challenge is to elucidate the brain mechanisms of MDD behavioral symptoms, chiefly those of anhedonia. Objective(s): To visualize the neuroanatomical substrates implicated in altered reward processing in MDD, using functional magnetic resonance imaging in combination with a dopaminergic probe (a 30-mg dose of oral dextroamphetamine sulfate) to stimulate the brain reward system; and to test the hypothesis that a hypersensitive response to dextroamphetamine in MDD involves the prefrontal cortex and the striatum. Design and Interventions: Among subjects with MDD and healthy control subjects, functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected before and after singleblind administration of dextroamphetamine. Setting(s): Subjects were recruited through local newspaper advertisements and by word of mouth. Participant(s): Twelve depressed subjects (mean age, 34.83 years; male-female ratio, 6:6) met criteria for MDD according to the DSM-IV, were not taking antidepressants, and had no comorbid Axis I disorders. Twelve control subjects (mean age, 29.33 years; male-female ratio, 5:7) were healthy volunteers without a history of Axis I disorders. Main Outcome Measure(s): Functional magnetic resonance imaging blood oxygen level-dependent activation was measured during a controlled task, and dextroamphetamine-induced subjective effects were assessed using the Addiction Research Center Inventory. Result(s): Subjects with MDD had a hypersensitive response to the rewarding effects of dextroamphetamine (2-fold increase; t 21=2.74, P=.01), with altered brain activation in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and the orbitofrontal cortex and the caudate and putamen (F1,44=11.93, P=.001). Conclusion(s): Dopamine-related neuroanatomical substrates are involved in altered reward processing in MDD, shedding light on the neurobiology of the anhedonic symptoms in MDD and suggesting these substrates as future therapeutic targets. ©2005 American Medical Association.

thalamus","Drugs of abuse are rewarding to addicted and nonaddicted subjects, but they trigger craving and compulsive intake only in addicted subjects. Here, we used positron emission tomography (PET) and [18F]deoxyglucose to compare the brain metabolic responses (marker of brain function) of cocaine-addicted subjects (n = 21) and controls (n = 15) to identify brain regions that are uniquely activated in addicted subjects by intravenous methylphenidate (a drug that cocaine-addicted subjects report to be similar to cocaine). In parallel, we also measured the changes in dopamine (DA) induced by intravenous methylphenidate (using PET and [11C]raclopride) in the striatum and in the thalamus. Metabolic responses between groups differed significantly only in the right medial orbital prefrontal cortex [Brodmann's area (BA) 25 and medial BA 11], where methylphenidate increased metabolism in addicted subjects but decreased metabolism in controls. These changes were associated in all subjects with increased ""desire for methylphenidate"" and in the addicted subjects with ""cocaine craving."" In addicted subjects, increases in BA 25 were also associated with mood elevation. Methylphenidate-induced increases in metabolism in the medial orbital prefrontal cortex were associated with its increase of DA in the thalamus but not in the striatum. These findings provide evidence that enhanced sensitivity of BA 25 (region involved with emotional reactivity) and BA 11 (region involved with salience attribution and motivation) in cocaine-addicted subjects may underlie the strong emotional response to the drug and the intense desire to procure it that results in craving and compulsive drug intake. It also suggests that the mesothalamic DA pathway may contribute to these processes. Copyright © 2005 Society for Neuroscience.",Journal of Neuroscience,13-Apr-05

visual hallucination","In Parkinson's disease, dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS) is characterized by severe dopamine addiction and behavioral disorders such as manic psychosis, hypersexuality, pathological gambling, and mood swings. Here, we describe the case of 2 young parkinsonian patients suffering from disabling motor fluctuations and dyskinesia associated with severe DDS. In addition to alleviating the motor disability in both patients, subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation greatly reduced the behavioral disorders as well as completely abolished the addiction to dopaminergic treatment. Dopaminergic addiction in patients with Parkinson's disease, therefore, does not constitute an obstacle to high-frequency STN stimulation, and this treatment may even cure the addiction. © 2005 Movement Disorder Society.",Movement Disorders,Aug-05

volumetry","Laboratory models, both animal and human, have made enormous contributions to our understanding of addiction. For addictive disorders, animal models have the great advantage of possessing both face validity and a significant degree of predictive validity, already demonstrated. Another important advantage to this field is the ability of reciprocal interplay between preclinical and clinical experiments. These models have made important contributions to the development of medications to treat addictive disorders and will likely result in even more advances in the future. Human laboratory models have gone beyond data obtained from patient histories and enabled investigators to make direct observations of human drug self-administration and test the effects of putative medications on this behavior. This review examines in detail some animal and human models that have led not only to important theories of addiction mechanisms but also to medications shown to be effective in the clinic.",Pharmacology and Therapeutics,Oct-05

Previously we observed that TMS motor threshold (MT) was elevated in abstinent cocaine-dependent subjects. In the current study we aimed at replicating our initial finding, exploring other TMS-based measures of excitability, and examining association with personality characteristics. Nineteen cocaine-dependent and 12 healthy control subjects were examined. Resting and activated motor thresholds (RMT and AMT) and duration of the cortical silent period (CSP) were examined. The Cocaine Experience Questionnaire (CEQ) was administered to assess cocaine-induced psychotic symptoms. The relationship between Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) scales and cortical excitability measures was also examined. AMT was significantly elevated in cocaine-dependent subjects on both hemispheres. RMT was also significantly elevated on the right hemisphere. No CSP changes were noted. Patients with cocaine-induced paranoia had longer CSPs on the right hemisphere compared to subjects reporting no paranoid experiences. The patients displayed significantly elevated scores on several MMPI scales, though the scale scores did not correlate with cortical excitability measures. These data support our initial finding of decreased cortical excitability in abstinent cocaine-dependent subjects. We interpret this finding as a compensatory mechanism against the stimulating and epileptogenic effects of cocaine. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Journal of Psychiatric Research,May-05

Objective(s): This study provides a 5 year follow up of PD patients treated with stimulation of the STN. Method(s): Thirty seven consecutive patients with PD treated with bilateral STN stimulation were assessed prospectively 6, 24, and 60 months after neurosurgery. Parkinsonian motor disability was evaluated with and without levodopa treatment, with and without bilateral STN stimulation. Neuropsychological and mood assessments included the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, the frontal score, and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Result(s): No severe peri- or immediate postoperative side effects were observed. Six patients died and one was lost to follow up. Five years after neurosurgery: (i) activity of daily living (Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) II) was improved by stimulation of the STN by 40% (""off"" drug) and 60% (""on"" drug); (ii) parkinsonian motor disability (UPDRS III) was improved by 54% (""off"" drug) and 73% (""on"" drug); (iii) the severity of levodopa related motor complications was decreased by 67% and the levodopa daily doses were reduced by 58%. The MADRS was unchanged, but cognitive performance declined significantly. Persisting adverse effects included eyelid opening apraxia, weight gain, addiction to levodopa treatment, hypomania and disinhibition, depression, dysarthria, dyskinesias, and apathy. Conclusion(s): Despite moderate motor and cognitive decline, probably due to disease progression, the marked improvement in motor function observed postoperatively was sustained 5 years after neurosurgery.","Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry",Dec-05

transcranial magnetic stimulation","Background: Dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex is implicated in craving for drugs and food. This study explores the effect of prefrontal cortex stimulation on food craving. Method(s): In a randomized double-blind parallel group study, 28 women, who reported frequent cravings for food were exposed to foods that typically elicit strong cravings before and after a single session of real or sham 10-Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex at an intensity of 110% individual motor threshold. Result(s): Self-reported food craving during exposure to the experimental foods remained stable before and after real stimulation compared with sham stimulation in which cravings increased over the experimental session. Consumption of snack foods within a 5-min period after stimulation did not differ between groups. Conclusion(s): Prefrontal stimulation inhibits the development of craving. A longer period of observation is necessary to establish whether there is an effect on food consumption. © 2005 Society of Biological Psychiatry.",Biological Psychiatry,15-Nov-05

An important question in addiction neuroscience thus concerns the neural substrates underlying these sex differences. Objective(s): This article aims to examine what is known of the neural mechanisms involved in the sex differences between substance abusers. Method(s): We reviewed neuroimaging studies that addressed sex differences in cerebral perfusion deficits after chronic cocaine use and in regional brain activation during pharmacologic challenge and cue-induced craving. We also present results from a preliminary study in which cocaine-dependent men and women participated in script-guided imagery of stress- and drug cue-related situations while blood oxygenation level-dependent signals of their brain were acquired in a 1.5T scanner. Spatial pre-processing and statistical analysis of brain images were performed. Regional brain activation was compared between stress and drug cue trials in men versus women. Result(s): The results of our study showed greater activation in the left uncus and right claustrum (both, statistical threshold of P = 0.01, uncorrected; extent = 10 voxels) in men (n = 5) during drug cue trials compared with stress trials. No brain regions showed greater activation during stress trials compared with drug cue trials. In contrast, women (n = 6) showed greater activation in the right medial and superior frontal gyri during stress trials compared with drug cue trials at the same statistical threshold. No brain regions showed more activation during drug cue trials than during stress trials. Conclusion(s): The studies reviewed underscore the need to consider sex-related factors in examining the neuropathology of cocaine addiction. Our preliminary results also suggest important sex differences in the effect of stress- and drug cue-associated brain activation in individuals with cocaine use disorder.

Neurocircuits and the neurochemical mediation of pleasure responses may represent a shared neurobiological substrate, linking addictions of both types. In this review, Pathological Gambling, Kleptomania, Compulsive Buying, Pyromania, and Problematic Internet Use are examined from a neurobiological perspective, with a specific focus on pleasure pathway responses.

review","Secondary prevention of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) entails intervening in the aftermath of a traumatic event to forestall the development of PTSD. There has been little psychopharmacologic research in this area. This is surprising, given that PTSD is the mental disorder with the most clearly identified cause and onset. In a translational model of PTSD's pathogenesis presented herein: A traumatic event (unconditioned stimulus) overstimulates endogenous stress hormones (unconditioned response); these mediate an overconsolidation of the event's memory trace; recall of the event in response to reminders (conditioned stimulus); releases further stress hormones (conditioned response); these cause further overconsolidation; and the overconsolidated memory generates PTSD symptoms. Noradrenergzc hyperactivity in the basolateral amygdala is hypothesized to mediate this cycle. Preventing pre-synaptic norepinephrine release with alpha2-adrenergic agonists or opioids, or blocking post-synaptic norepinephrine sreceptors with beta-adrenergic antagonists such as propranolol, reduces hormonally enhanced memories and fear conditioning. Two controlled studies of trauma victims presenting to emergency rooms suggest that posttrauma propranolol reduces subsequent PTSD, as does one naturalistic clinical study of morphine treatment of burned children. Cortisol both enhances memory consolidation and reduces memory retrieval, leading to mixed predictions. Two controlled studies of intensive care unit patients found that cortisol reduced PTSD. One study did not find benzodiazepines effective in preventing PTSD. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, antiepileptics, and alpha2-adrenergic agonists have yet to be tried.",CNS Spectrums,Feb-05

From a clinical point of view, the description of those behaviours needs the recognition of difference between post-modern cultural activities and pathological behaviours. Concept of ""risk"" was not regarded as a good principle of classification before, and the class of ""risk taking behaviours"" is a new category of diseases. In the past, risk-taking behaviours have been considered as indirect self-destructive behaviours or as addictions. Now, that class of pathological behaviours is autonomous and requires, as characteristic, the active search of danger without precaution. Generally, risk-taking behaviours begin with an ""initiation experience"", which is keeping a high psychical importance, patients trying to obtain the same satisfaction by repetition of acts. Psychopathological interpretation leads to different patterns: 1/ sensation seeking, and opposition between sensations and emotions, 2/ mastery of libidinal excitation, 3/ ""ordalic"" behaviour, and 4/ new libidinal economy and repetition. The first conception is based on Zuckerman theory (""sensation seeking theory""). Some patients may experience a low level of cortical arousal and risk-taking behaviours may help them in producing excitation. This theory could explain some parts of those behaviours. But an additional factor is necessary: the opposition between sensations (physiological) and emotions (psychical, affects, feelings). The main problem is that taking risk patients suffer from experiencing emotions, which threaten them and try to avoid them in producing high sensations. The theory of mastery of libidinal excitation develops the idea that object relationship are threatening the subject who seems unconsciously depending on the libidinal object. Jeammet, Marcelli insist on the default of ""narcissic seating"" or on the fragility of primary narcissism among those patients. In front of the excitation induced by libidinal objects, a psychical working out is impossible. So the patient tries to control or to avoid the excitation by some acts (acting out). Pleasure of risk-taking behaviours derives from the physical sensations and, above all, from the victory on the power of the libidinal object. Secondary, the pleasure is depending from the attitude of the others: fascination, connection with a group of initiate persons. The theory of ordalic behaviour insists on the problem of identity. Ordalic behaviours are considered as repeated acts of facing to danger; they lead to a feeling of regeneration, of new birth by facing with death. The principal aims of ordalic behaviours are not a self-destruction but the possibility of living. Some patients have such identity and narcissic problems that they have to repeat those ordalic experiences to maintain the ""positive"" consequences of the behaviour. The ordalic behaviours allow having body limits, to cancel the difference between Ego and Ideal Ego, to produce symbolic identity. Some risk-taking behaviours are repeated and some patients begin dependent on the experience. Some authors regarded these behaviours, in that case, as addictions (repetition and dependence) to risk. The first problem is to understand what ""risk"" is representing in the subjectivity because of the certainty and uncertainty of the consequences of the action. The second aspect is that the theory of addictions brings an interpretation of risk-taking behaviours. The theory insists on some transformations: need instead of wish, material object instead of libidinal object, and specific action instead of demand... Some patients with risk-taking behaviours show a lack of introjections and a strong use of incorporation. The four interpretations are not opposed but complementary. Those interpretations may share the same principle: the behaviour is used to avoid dependence to the libidinal object and leads to another dependence. © 2004 Elsevier SAS.

upregulation","The neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is ubiquitous in the central nervous system (CNS) throughout life. In addition to trophic effects on target neurons, BDNF appears to be part of a general mechanism for activity-dependent modification of synapses in the developing and adult nervous system. Thus, diseases of abnormal trophic support (such as neurodegenerative diseases) and diseases of abnormal excitability (such as epilepsy and central pain sensitization) can be related in some cases to abnormal BDNF signaling. For example, various studies have shown that BDNF is upregulated in areas implicated in epileptogenesis, and interference with BDNF signal transduction inhibits the development of the epileptic state. Further study of the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which BDNF influences cell survival and excitability will likely provide novel concepts and targets for the treatment of diverse CNS diseases.",,2004

They are taken in large quantities by athletes and others to increase performance, often with negative long-term health consequences. As a result, in 1991, testosterone was declared a controlled substance. Recently, Brower [K.J. Brower, Anabolic steroid abuse and dependence. Curr. Psychiatry Rep. 4 (2002) 377a-387.] proposed a two-stage model of AAS dependence. Users initiate steroid use for their anabolic effects on muscle growth. With continued exposure, dependence on the psychoactive effects of AAS develops. However, it is difficult in humans to separate direct psychoactive effects of AAS from the user's psychological dependence on the anabolic effects of AAS. Thus, studies in laboratory animals are useful to explore androgen reinforcement. Testosterone induces a conditioned place preference in rats and mice, and is voluntarily consumed through oral, intravenous, and intracerebroventricular self-administration in hamsters. Active, gonad-intact male and female hamsters will deliver 1 mug/mul testosterone into the lateral ventricles. Indeed, some individuals self-administer testosterone intracerebroventricularly to the point of death. Male rats develop a conditioned place preference to testosterone injections into the nucleus accumbens, an effect blocked by dopamine receptor antagonists. These data suggest that androgen reinforcement is mediated by the brain. Moreover, testosterone appears to act through the mesolimbic dopamine system, a common substrate for drugs of abuse. Nonetheless, androgen reinforcement is not comparable to that of cocaine or heroin. Instead, testosterone resembles other mild reinforcers, such as caffeine, nicotine, or benzodiazepines. The potential for androgen addiction remains to be determined. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Physiology and Behavior,15-Nov-04

withdrawal syndrome","Imaging studies have revealed neurochemical and functional changes in the brains of drug-addicted subjects that provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying addiction. Neurochemical studies have shown that large and fast increases in dopamine are associated with the reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse, but also that after chronic drug abuse and during withdrawal, brain dopamine function is markedly decreased and these decreases are associated with dysfunction of prefrontal regions (including orbitofrontal cortex and cingulate gyrus). The changes in brain dopamine function are likely to result in decreased sensitivity to natural reinforcers since dopamine also mediates the reinforcing effects of natural reinforcers and on disruption of frontal cortical functions, such as inhibitory control and salience attribution. Functional imaging studies have shown that during drug intoxication, or during craving, these frontal regions become activated as part of a complex pattern that includes brain circuits involved with reward (nucleus accumbens), motivation (orbitofrontal cortex), memory (amygdala and hippocampus), and cognitive control (prefrontal cortex and cingulate gyrus). Here, we integrate these findings and propose a model that attempts to explain the loss of control and compulsive drug intake that characterize addiction. Specifically, we propose that in drug addiction the value of the drug and drug-related stimuli is enhanced at the expense of other reinforcers. This is a consequence of conditioned learning and of the resetting of reward thresholds as an adaptation to the high levels of stimulation induced by drugs of abuse. In this model, during exposure to the drug or drug-related cues, the memory of the expected reward results in overactivation of the reward and motivation circuits while decreasing the activity in the cognitive control circuit. This contributes to an inability to inhibit the drive to seek and consume the drug and results in compulsive drug intake. This model has implications for therapy, for it suggests a multi-prong approach that targets strategies to decrease the rewarding properties of drugs, to enhance the rewarding properties of alternative reinforcers, to interfere with conditioned-learned associations, and to strengthen cognitive control in the treatment of drug addiction.",Journal of Clinical Investigation,May-03

vomiting / side effect","Pain is a common experience of mankind. Pain theories and the management of pain have been modified throughout the history of mankind. This article gives a brief review on pain, pain believes and pain management from early magico-demonic and magico-religeous ideas and procedures to more empiric-scientific models; from ancient times and primitive cultures to the 20th century. Due to new anatomical, physiological and biochemical insights, modern pain theories developed in the 19th and 20th century. Modern analgesics were synthesized and new invasive procedures were approved having a major impact on pain management strategies. However, older traditional beliefs and attitudes have not been replaced completely and have survived to some degree in modern patients. © 2004 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",Current Pharmaceutical Design,2004

task performance","The brain mechanisms underlying the cause of nicotine dependence are unknown, however, hostility traits are associated with increased susceptibility to nicotine dependence. We used FDG PET to measure brain metabolic response to nicotine administered by patch while the subject performed the Bushman aggression task in 86 high- and low-hostility subjects. Low-hostility trait subjects demonstrated no significant change in brain metabolic response to nicotine. In marked contrast, high-hostility non-smokers subjects demonstrated dramatic metabolic changes to low dose (3.5 mg patch) as did high-hostility smokers to high dose nicotine (21 mg patch) throughout the brain bilaterally (p<0.025). Correlational analyses demonstrated greater metabolic changes in response to nicotine in subjects with greatest hostility trait measures. The observed differences were not a consequence of plasma nicotine or cotinine levels. These metabolic changes were not observed when subjects performed a sustained attentional task (continuous performance task; CPT). Behaviorally, high-hostility subjects had higher ratings of anger, impatience, irritability and nervousness, and lower ratings of happiness, relaxation and curiosity than low-hostility subjects. Smokers had significantly greater scores on impatience and restlessness than non-smokers. This PET study demonstrates a conspicuous lack of the brain metabolic response to nicotine in low-hostility non-smokers in contrast to a dramatic brain response to nicotine in high hostility subjects. This biological difference in brain metabolic response to nicotine between high and low hostility trait subjects may explain differences in susceptibility to nicotine dependence. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

This interest was additionally encouraged by the observation of an association between reward and dopamine activity in the mesocorticolimbic system. In this article, we will discuss the complex nature of reward processing and recent animal studies and human functional neuroimaging studies to elucidate the current understanding of the neural substrates of reward processing and its components. Lastly, we will review recent theoretical and empirical work investigating the role of brain reward circuitry in several psychiatric disorders, including substance use disorders, schizophrenia, pathologic gambling, major depressive disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

Treatment is recommended when the tremor becomes disabling. Propranolol or primidone are first-line treatments, each improving tremor in approximately 50% of patients. The medications can be used in combination if ineffective alone. Benzodiazepines may be useful in patients with concomitant anxiety and are also a second-line treatment option for patients who have failed to respond to first-line therapy. Other second-line treatment options include. gabapentin, topiramate and botulinum toxin A. If essential tremor remains uncontrolled after trying a number of medications, surgical treatments such as thalamotomy or deep brain stimulation of the thalamus may be considered. © 2004 Adis Data Information BV.

vomiting / drug therapy","Cannabis is not only a widely abused drug, but also has the potential for the development of useful agents for the treatment of emesis, anorexia and several neurological disorders. In this article we will review the biology of endogenous cannabinoid system and the effects of modulation of transmitter release by cannabinoids in the nervous system. During the past decade, two cannabinoid receptors, named CB1 and CB2, were identified. Putative endogenous ligands at these receptors were discovered as anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol, and several research tools were identified, including receptor agonists and antagonists, antibodies, antisense oligodeoxynucleotides, and CB1 and CB2 receptor knockout mice. CB1 receptor is negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase and is either negatively or positively associated to ion channels. The localization of CB1 receptors justifies the effects of cannabinoids in the central nervous system, including the control of movement, memory impairment, analgesia and addiction. The main function of the endocannabinoid system is to regulate synaptic transmission in excitatory and inhibitory pathways in the brain. In this respect, it is relevant that the majority of cannabinoid receptors is located presynaptically on neurons where their activation causes the inhibition of the release of the respective neurotransmitter, an action that is shared in common with opioid receptors. CB1 receptor-mediated inhibition of transmitter release might explain the reinforcing properties and memory impairment caused by cannabinoids. Moreover, it may be relevant to the therapeutic potentials of cannabinoids. ©2004 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",Current Neuropharmacology,Jan-04

Fundamental questions include whether this error-related activation provides a signal contributing to behavioral control and, given generally poorer performance on such tasks by addicts, whether this signal is disrupted in addiction. Methods We used rapid, event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging to study 13 individuals with opiate dependence and 26 healthy control individuals performing a Go/NoGo task. Results Compared with controls, opiate addicts exhibited an attenuated anterior cingulate cortex error signal and significantly poorer task performance. In controls, the individual level of event-related anterior cingulate cortex activation accompanying false alarm error positively predicted task performance, particularly sensitivity in discriminating targets from nontargets. Conclusions The attenuation of this error signal in anterior cingulate cortex may play a role in loss of control in addiction and other forms of impulsive behavior.",Biological Psychiatry,01-Mar-04

*reward","Amphetamines are highly addictive drugs that have pronounced effects on emotional and cognitive behavior in humans. These effects are mediated through their potent dopaminergic agonistic properties. Dopamine has also been implicated in the modulation of responses of the 'reward circuit' in animal and human studies. In this study we use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify the brain circuitry involved in the psychostimulant effect of methamphetamine in psychostimulant-naive human subjects. Seven healthy volunteers were scanned in a 3T MR imaging system. They received single-blind intravenous infusions of methamphetamine (0.15 mg/kg), and rated their experience of 'mind-racing' on a button press throughout the experiment. Data were analyzed with statistical parametric mapping methods. Amphetamine administration activated the medial orbitofrontal cortex, the rostral part of the anterior cingulate cortex, and the ventral striatum. Ratings of 'mind-racing' after methamphetamine infusion correlated with activations in the rostral part of the anterior cingulate cortex and in the ventral striatum. In addition, activations in the medial orbitofrontal cortex were independent of motor and related responses involved in making the ratings. These findings indicate that the first administration of a psychostimulant to human subjects activates classical reward circuitry. Our data also support recent hypotheses suggesting a central role for the orbitofrontal cortex in drug reinforcement and the development of addiction.",Neuropsychopharmacology,Sep-04

taste","Microdialysis studies in animals have shown that addictive drugs preferentially increase extracellular dopamine (DA) in the n. accumbens (NAc). Brain imaging studies, while extending these finding to humans, have shown a correlation between psychostimulant-induced increase of extracellular DA in the striatum and self-reported measures of liking and 'high' (euphoria). Although a correlate of drug reward independent from associative learning and performance is difficult to obtain in animals, conditioned taste avoidance (CTA) might meet these requirements. Addictive drugs induce CTA to saccharin most likely as a result of anticipatory contrast of saccharin over drug reward. Consistently with a role of DA in drug reward, D2 or combined D1/D2 receptor blockade abolishes cocaine, amphetamine and nicotine CTA. Intracranial self-administration studies with mixtures of D1 and D2 receptor agonists point to the NAc shell as the critical site of DA reward. NAc shell DA acting on D1 receptors is also involved in Pavlovian learning through pre-trial and post-trial consolidation mechanisms and in the utilization of spatial short-term memory for goal-directed behavior. Stimulation of NAc shell DA transmission by addictive drugs is shared by a natural reward like food but lacks its adaptive properties (habituation and inhibition by predictive stimuli). These peculiarities of drug-induced stimulation of DA transmission in the NAc shell result in striking differences in the impact of drug-conditioned stimuli on DA transmission. It is speculated that drug addiction results from the impact exerted on behavior by the abnormal DA stimulant properties acquired by drug-conditioned stimuli as a result of their association with addictive drugs. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

*signal transduction","Identification of opiate receptors some 30 years ago provided tools that brought major new insights into how these drugs act and led to the discovery of a novel group of atypical neurotransmitters, the peptide enkephalins being the first. The ligand binding techniques that were used to identify opiate receptors were employed to characterize receptors for all of the major neurotransmitters in the brain leading to additional insights into the actions of many drugs, such as neuroleptics. These techniques also permitted characterization of intracellular signaling systems such as the IP3 receptor and immunophilins. Even more novel than the enkephalins have been the gaseous neurotransmitters NO and CO and D-serine. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Neuropharmacology,2004

wellbeing","High-frequency deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) improves the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Opposite changes in mood, such as mania or depression, have been reported after surgery, but it is not known whether these side effects are specifically related to STN DBS. To learn whether STN DBS also influences the limbic loop, we investigated acute subjective psychotropic effects related to levodopa or bilateral STN DBS. After a median postoperative follow-up of 12 months, 50 PD patients completed the Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI), assessing subjective psychotropic effects in four conditions: off-drug/on-stimulation; off-drug/ off-stimulation; on-drug/off-stimulation; and on-drug/on-stimulation. Both levodopa and STN DBS improved all the ARCI subscales, indicating subjective feelings of well being, euphoria, increase in motivation, and decrease in fatigue, anxiety, and tension. A suprathreshold dose of levodopa was significantly more effective than STN DBS, using the same electrical parameters as for chronic stimulation, on four of the five ARCI subscales. We concluded that 1) both STN DBS and levodopa have synergistic acute beneficial psychotropic effects in PD, 2) the psychotropic effects of both treatments need to be considered in the long-term management of chronic STN DBS, and 3) the results indicate an involvement of the limbic STN in mood disorders of PD. © 2003 Movement Disorder Society.",Movement Disorders,01-May-03

An integrated model explains craving and relapse in humans by the psychological mechanism of ""attentional bias"" and provides neuropsychopharmacological mechanisms for this bias. According to this model, cognitive processes mediate between drug stimulus and the subject's response to this stimulus and subsequent behavioral response (e.g., drug use, relapse). According to the model, a conditioned drug stimulus produces an increase in dopamine levels in the corticostriatal circuit, in particular the anterior cingulate gyrus, amygdala, and nucleus accumbens, which in turn serves to draw the subject's attention towards a perceived drug stimulus. This process results in motor preparation and a hyperattentive state towards drug-related stimuli that, ultimately, promotes further craving and relapse. Evidence for this attentional bias hypothesis is reviewed from both the psychopharmacological and the neuroanatomical viewpoints. The attentional bias hypothesis raises several suggestions for clinical approaches and further research. © 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

Some state- and trait-related issues of theta power increases in the EEG of alcoholics were also examined. Method(s): Absolute theta (3-7 Hz) power in eyes-closed EEGs of 307 alcohol-dependent subjects and 307 age- and gender-matched unaffected controls were compared by using a repeated-measures ANOVA for the entire region and three subregions (frontal, central, and parietal) separately. Supplementary to the main analysis, the effect of three clinical variables on absolute theta power was examined separately for each gender by using correlation and regression analyses. Gender differences in the theta log power difference between alcoholics and controls were explored by using regional repeated-measures ANOVA. Result(s): Increased absolute theta power was seen in alcohol-dependent subjects at all scalp locations. The theta log power increase in male alcoholics was prominent at the central and parietal regions and in female alcoholics at the parietal region when compared with the respective matched controls. Correlation of drinking variables with log theta power exhibited no group-specific differences. Conclusion(s): Increased tonic theta power in the EEG may reflect a deficiency in the information-processing capacity of the central nervous system in alcoholics. The theta power increase may also be an electrophysiological index of the imbalance in the excitation-inhibition homeostasis in the cortex. It is likely that the theta power increase is a trait-related phenomenon and is expressed to differing degrees in the two genders.",Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research,01-Apr-03

sweetness","How does the brain cause positive affective reactions to sensory pleasure? An answer to pleasure causation requires knowing not only which brain systems are activated by pleasant stimuli, but also which systems actually cause their positive affective properties. This paper focuses on brain causation of behavioral positive affective reactions to pleasant sensations, such as sweet tastes. Its goal is to understand how brain systems generate 'liking,' the core process that underlies sensory pleasure and causes positive affective reactions. Evidence suggests activity in a subcortical network involving portions of the nucleus accumbens shell, ventral pallidum, and brainstem causes 'liking' and positive affective reactions to sweet tastes. Lesions of ventral pallidum also impair normal sensory pleasure. Recent findings regarding this subcortical network's causation of core 'liking' reactions help clarify how the essence of a pleasure gloss gets added to mere sensation. The same subcortical 'liking' network, via connection to brain systems involved in explicit cognitive representations, may also in turn cause conscious experiences of sensory pleasure. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

weight gain","Intractable OCD and depression cause tremendous suffering in those affected and in their families. The impaired ability to function of those affected imposes a heavy burden on society as a whole. Existing data suggest that lesion procedures offer benefit to a large proportion (ranging from about 35%-70%) of patients with intractable OCD and depression. The literature also suggests that although serious long-term adverse events have occurred, these are relatively infrequent overall. Methodologic limitations of the earlier reports on any of these procedures were described previously in this article. The major academic centers conducting this work have since been obtaining systematic prospective data using modern assessment tools. Nevertheless, even with improved methodologies, more recent studies confront some remaining issues that have been difficult to overcome fully. First, the number of patients who have received any one procedure has been relatively small, constraining statistical power. This limits the ability of researchers to enhance patient selection based on clinical characteristics. This is important, because patients with intractable OCD and depression referred for neurosurgery have high rates of comorbid Axis I diagnoses, personality disorders, and functional impairments, which may have value in predicting response. Other features, such as age of onset, chronicity, and symptom subtypes, may be likewise useful. Another key factor in response may be postoperative management, which has varied most over time but also across patients enrolled in trials. As noted previously, randomized controlled trials of neurosurgical treatment for intractable psychiatric illness have not been reported, although one has been proposed for gamma knife capsulotomy in intractable OCD [23]. The development of deep brain stimulation has also made sham-controlled studies possible and also allows within-patient designs to be considered. Bearing these problems in mind, the literature does provide important guidance on a number of key points, including approaches to referral, patient selection, and the need for long-term prospective follow-up and postoperative management. Nevertheless, important gaps in knowledge remain in all these areas. Research is expected to narrow these gaps in a number of ways, including patient selection, optimizing the procedures themselves, and understanding the mechanisms of therapeutic action. Neuroimaging studies will play a key role in achieving these aims (see the article by Rauch in this issue). So will cross-species translational research on the anatomy and physiology of the pathways implicated in the pathophysiology and response to treatment in these disorders. Future research in psychiatric neurosurgery must proceed cautiously. A recent editorial statement of the OCD-DBS Collaborative Group [26] recommends a minimum set of standards for any multidisciplinary teams contemplating work in this domain. The rationale for those standards is found throughout this issue and is especially developed in the article by Fins. The need for safe and effective therapeutic options for people suffering with these severe illnesses is just as clear. The experience over the last several decades provides grounds for careful optimism that refined lesion procedures or reversible deep brain stimulation may relieve suffering and improve the lives of people with these devastating disorders.",Neurosurgery Clinics of North America,01-Apr-03

This is likely to reflect its vasoactive effects; cocaine produces vasoconstriction and reduces cerebral blood flow. We propose that cerebrovascular pathology in chronic cocaine abusers would result in abnormal BOLD [blood oxygenation level dependent] responses to activation stimuli. Here, we used fMRI to compared the BOLD response to photic visual stimulation in neurologically intact active cocaine abusers to that in non-drug-using healthy controls. Cocaine abusers showed a significantly enhanced positive BOLD response to photic stimulation when compared to control subjects. The enhanced activation in the cocaine abusers could result from low resting cerebral blood flow secondary to increased vasoconstriction and/or from low oxidative metabolism during activation. Alternatively, the larger signal intensity in the cocaine abusers could result from inefficient neuronal processing as has been shown to occur in other conditions of cerebral pathology. These findings provide evidence of cerebral dysfunction with chronic cocaine abuse, which could reflect cerebral blood flow or neuronal changes. Further studies are required to determine if the cerebrovascular changes we observed in the cocaine abusers recover with detoxification and to assess their functional consequences. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

ventral tegmentum","Psychopharmacological studies have implicated the dopaminergic innervation of the nucleus accumbens (NAC) in reward and reinforcement, in the actions of addictive drugs, and in the control of the symptoms of schizophrenia. Recent developments in in vivo dialysis, and other in vivo neurochemical techniques have permitted a more direct analysis of the behavioural correlates of increased dopamine release in rats, and have largely confirmed these findings in relation to reward, and drugs of abuse potential. However, dopamine release has also been found to be increased by many other stimuli/situations including aversive stimuli, stimuli conditioned to aversive stimuli, complex novel stimuli, and in the process of conditioning itself. These results contrast with electrophysiological data obtained in the behaving monkey, where rewarding stimuli, or stimuli predictive of reward are associated with increased firing of presumptive dopamine neurones projecting to the NAC (and indeed to the striatum), but mild aversive stimuli are not, leading to the suggestion that this system subserves a more purely reward function, or indeed that it provides a reward error signal. Further exploration of these issues will depend upon a comparison of increased dopamine cell firing and increased dopamine release, and an analysis of the behavioural effects of blocking these increases in dopamine transmission. One suggestion, deriving from work on latent inhibition, is that the significance of dopamine release by salient stimuli is to allow learning about stimuli which would otherwise be excluded on the basis of familiarity. This suggests that in addition to a role in some types of learning about salient stimuli, dopamine release in NAC may have a role in controlling the attention paid to familiar stimuli. Since it is difficult to see a connection between simple learning about rewards, and the symptoms of schizophrenia, this provides a more convincing link between the dopamine theory of schizophrenia, and the attentional difficulties held by many theorists to underlie schizophrenic symptoms. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

In the present study, the influence of alcohol-related stimuli in alcoholic patients was investigated. Subjects were 10 alcoholic inpatients (3 female) and 10 age- and sex-matched controls. Eight alcohol-related and 8 neutral words served as stimuli in a visual oddball paradigm. Acohol-related words were targets (48 stimuli, 33%) and neutral words were standard stimuli (96 stimuli, 66%). Results showed that P300 amplitude for targets did not differ significantly between the two groups. However, P300 latency for targets as well as reaction time were significantly shorter in male alcoholic patients. In contrast, P300 latency was increased in female alcoholic patients but reaction time did not differ. These results suggest that male alcoholics process information linked to alcohol cues more rapidly than neutral cues, probably because a specific semantic network is activated in these patients. The decreased reaction time confirms the impulsive behavior frequently found in male alcoholism, as it has been described in type II alcoholism. Besides, the results imply that information processing was delayed in female alcoholic patients. Therefore this study demonstrates a gender-dependent impact of alcohol-related stimuli on information processing. Copyright © 2003 S. Karger AG, Basel.",Neuropsychobiology,2003

A future challenge is to determine how particular neuroadaptations lead to plasticity in these systems, whether such changes are reversible, and how pharmacological treatments may be used to modify these processes and thereby reduce compulsive drug seeking and the propensity for relapse in human addicts.",Journal of Neuroscience,01-May-02

The somatic-marker hypothesis posits that decision-making is a process that depends on emotion and that deficits in emotional signaling will lead to poor decision-making. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that SDI who perform disadvantageously on a decision-making instrument, the gambling task (GT), have a deficit in the somatic signals that help guide their decision in the advantageous direction. Since deficits in decision-making/somatic markers can also result from dysfunctional amygdala, we asked indirectly (i.e. via tests sensitive to VM or amygdala dysfunction) whether such a deficit in SDI is restricted to VM dysfunction or includes the amygdala. Using the GT, and skin conductance response (SCR) as an index of somatic state activation, we studied groups of SDI (n=46), normal controls (n=49), and VM patients (n=10). A subgroup of SDI showed defective performance on the GT coupled with impaired anticipatory SCR, but normal SCR to punishment, and normal acquisition of conditioned SCR to an aversive loud sound. This supports the hypothesis that the poor decision-making in some SDI is associated with defective somatic state activation that is linked to a dysfunctional VM cortex. Thus, the dysfunctional VM cortex underlying the ""myopia"" for the future in some SDI may be one of the principle mechanisms underlying the transition from casual substance taking to compulsive and uncontrollable behavior. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

transdermal patch","Rationale: Buprenorphine is a potent mu-receptor partial agonist and is widely used as an analgesic drug. It is also increasingly considered to be an alternative to methadone in the maintenance and eventual detoxification of heroin addicts, and also in the treatment of cocaine addiction. So far, buprenorphine has been available as a sublingual tablet and as a solution for IV injection. Recently, a new transdermal formulation of buprenorphine in slow-release matrix patches has been introduced (Transtec) for the treatment of intermediate to severe pain. Objective(s): The aim of this paper is to review, from a preclinical perspective, the current status of what is known about the behavioral pharmacology of buprenorphine, with a particular emphasis on the issues of reward, addiction, and dependence. It will also point to open questions that should be addressed in the future to improve our understanding of the effects and the mechanisms of action of this drug. Result(s) and Conclusion(s): Since buprenorphine is a potent opioid drug, the issue of addiction and dependence in this context is an important one. Although there are still some gaps in the behavioral pharmacological characterization of buprenorphine, the general conclusion that can be drawn from the reviewed literature is that despite the high affinity of buprenorphine for the mu receptor it appears to be a remarkably safe drug, with a benign overall side effect profile and low addictive and dependence-inducing potential. This favorable side effect profile appears to be due, to a large extent, to the partial agonistic properties of the drug, in combination with its particular receptor kinetics (i.e. very slow dissociation from the mu receptor after binding).",Psychopharmacology,2002

*stress","Clinical and preclinical evidence links stress to drug dependence. Stress is accompanied by the rapid modification of brain and body physiology which leads to release of neuroactive hormones, including biogenic amines and adrenal steroids, which activate the same brain circuitry, as stimulant drugs, such as cocaine and amphetamines. Some preclinical studies showed that stress and elevated plasma concentrations of glucocorticoids increase acquisition and maintenance of stimulant use in rats, whereas other studies revealed that animals with inherently hypoactive HPA axis are more vulnerable to stimulant ""abuse"". In humans cocaine acutely activates the HPA axis, and in chronic cocaine abusers early abstinence is accompanied by alterations of the HPA axis function, with distinct patterns of hormonal changes characteristic for different subgroups of addicts. Some of these changes correspond to psychiatric comorbidities, which may be predictive of propensity to relapse. Hemispheric laterality plays a role in the stress-induced activation of the HPA axis, with right prefrontal cortex (PFC) having mostly stimulatory effects and the left, inhibitory effects. Brain-imaging studies showed preferential alteration of structure and function of the right cerebral hemisphere in cocaine addicts. Activation of the right PFC and inhibition of the left was noted in typical depressive disorders, and right hemispheric hypoactivity was reported in attention deficit hyperactivity and antisocial personality disorders, which are highly comorbid with stimulant dependence. Distinct patterns of hemispheric predominance or hypofunction between individuals may contribute to vulnerability or resilience to stimulant dependence. The nature and significance of the link between stress and activity of HPA axis, and vulnerability to drug dependence is not clear and deserves further study.",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2002

vein","Scientists have been aware of the existence of a complex relationship between stress and the subsequent activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the endocrine and neurobehavioral effects of cocaine for many years now. Our research program has focused on the involvement of HPA axis activation in cocaine reinforcement using the intravenous self-administration model. Behaviorally, there are at least three general phases in the etiology of drug self-administration to consider: acquisition, maintenance and reinstatement. We have investigated the role for the HPA axis during each of these three phases. Corticosterone is necessary during acquisition; self-administration does not occur unless this stress-related hormone is increased above a threshold critical for reward. Sensitivity to low doses of cocaine falling on the ascending limb of the acquisition dose-response curve can be augmented by increasing circulating levels of corticosterone, but similar treatments do not affect responding maintained by higher doses. In a similar vein, ongoing, low-dose cocaine self-administration is decreased by drugs affecting the synthesis and/or secretion of corticosterone. When higher doses falling on the descending limb of the cocaine dose-response curve are self-administered, plasma corticosterone can still reach this hypothetical reward threshold even when synthesis is inhibited, and drug intake is not affected. On the other hand, the self-administration of doses falling on both the ascending and descending limbs of the cocaine dose-response curve can each be attenuated by drugs that block central corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) receptors. Finally, corticosterone and CRH are also critical for the stress- and cue-induced reinstatement of extinguished cocaine-seeking behavior, demonstrating an involvement of the HPA axis in the relapse to cocaine use as well. Continued investigations into how stress and the subsequent activation of the HPA axis affect cocaine self-administration will likely result in the identification of more effective and efficient treatment for cocaine addiction. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Of particular significance is activity elicited by identifiable stimuli or events: event-related potentials (ERPs). One extensively studied ERP is kontingentni negativni variace (CNV). This electrical phenomenon consists of slow surface negativity that depends upon the association or contingency of two successive stimuli. A first stimulus (S1) serves as a preparatory signal for an imperative stimulus (S2), to which a motor or mental response is made. In lasts decades the CNV became one of the most intensively studied cognitive potentials (besides P300, Mismatch negativity and bereitschaftspotential) served to an examination of many neuropsychological syndromes (disorder of behavior, concentration, motivation, personality type assessment, influence of stress, aging etc.) and various neurological disorders (epilepsy, headache, cerebral palsy, trauma, extrapyramidal disorders etc.). The CNV have acquired its important place even in the psychiatry - CNV abnormalities have been reported in various types of depression, phobias, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorders, alcoholism etc. The use of the CNV seems to be effective in neuropharmacology and psychopharmacology. Regarding the anatomical structures, the complex neuronal cortical and subcortical networks are considered as generators of the CNV.",Psychiatrie,2001

Method(s): Brain activity was measured in cocaine addicts and healthy subjects by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while the subjects watched videotapes designed to elicit happy feelings, sad feelings, or the desire to use cocaine. The subjects indicated the onset of drug craving or emotional response, allowing comparison of groups before and after such feelings. Result(s): Robust activation of the anterior cingulate was evident in patients watching cocaine-cue tapes but not in patients watching happy or sad tapes or in healthy subjects under any condition. Anterior cingulate activation preceded the reported onset of craving and was evident in patients who did not report craving. In contrast, patients showed less activation than healthy subjects during the cocaine-cue tapes in areas of the frontal lobes. After the reported onset of craving, cocaine-dependent subjects showed greater activity than healthy subjects in regions that are more active in healthy subjects when they watch sad tapes than when they watch happy tapes, suggesting a physiologic link between cocaine-cue responses and normal dysphoric states. Dynamic aspects of regional brain activations, but not the location of activations, were abnormal in cocaine-dependent subjects watching sad tapes, suggesting more general affective dysregulation. Patients showed low activation of sensory areas during initial viewing of all videotapes, suggesting generalized alteration in neuroresponsiveness. Conclusion(s): Cocaine cues lead to abnormally high cingulate and low frontal lobe activation in cocaine addicts. Addicts also show more general abnormalities in affect-related brain activation.",American Journal of Psychiatry,2001

Motivated by these findings, we examined in opiate addicts whether brain regions involved in the reward circuitry also react to human prototypical rewards. We measured regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) with H215O positron emission tomography (PET) during a visuo-spatial recognition task with delayed response in control subjects and in opiate addicts participating in a methadone program. Three conditions were defined by the types of feedback: nonsense feedback; nonmonetary reinforcement; or monetary reward, received by the subjects for a correct response. We found in the control subjects rCBF increases in regions associated with the meso-striatal and meso-corticolimbic circuits in response to both monetary reward and nonmonetary reinforcement. In opiate addicts, these regions were activated only in response to monetary reward. Furthermore, nonmonetary reinforcement elicited rCBF increases in limbic regions of the opiate addicts that were not activated in the control subjects. Because psychoactive drugs serve as rewards and directly affect regions of the dopaminergic system like the striatum, we conclude that the differences in rCBF increases between controls and addicts can be attributed to an adaptive consequence of the addiction process.",European Journal of Neuroscience,2001

The diagnosis was determined by a pediatric neurologist and a psychologist examined all 27 subjects with tests that included the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R) and reading, writing, handedness, personality, and anxiety scores. Subjects with histories of epilepsy, head injury, drug abuse, or psychotic disorders were excluded. Culturally based causes or emotional disorders were also excluded. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was performed on all subjects, with recording of the motor evoked potential at the biceps brachii. Central motor conduction time was calculated by cervical root stimulation. Due to shape variability, the amplitude of the motor responses was not measured in the study. The mean value of central conduction time in the subjects was very significantly increased (P < .001) compared to that in a group of normal controls, case-matched for IQ, age, and sex. A central motor conduction time greater than 12 ms indicates abnormality. A second finding in the subjects was the significant difference of central conduction time on the side-to-side stimulation (P = .03). These findings are correlated with delay in the maturation of the corticomotoneuronal system and might provide neurophysiologic data for diagnosis.",Journal of Child Neurology,2000

relapse","Background: Relapse is a major problem in the treatment of addictive behaviors. Conditioning models of alcohol addiction suggest that stimuli associated with previous drug use (cues) may initiate relapse in a definite group of alcoholics. Event-related potentials (ERPs) might be useful to reveal the brain functional substrates of cue-reactivity. Method(s): In a preliminary investigation, 11 alcohol-dependent patients who did not take part in the electrophysiological study completed a structured interview to rate 80 words as to the degree of relatedness to alcohol. Based on these results, cue-reactivity for 15 alcohol-related and 15 unrelated word cues, each repeated eight times, was investigated in 19 alcohol-dependent men (44.2 +/- 8.5 years) and 19 healthy control men (42.5 +/- 12.5 years). Result(s): A cue-reactivity that consisted of significantly higher amplitudes in the ERPs after alcohol-related words compared with unrelated words was found in alcohol-dependent patients, but not in controls, at the electrode location Pz [F(1,36) = 5.2, p < 0.05]. Conclusion(s): Consistent with the hypothesis, only alcohol-dependent patients were characterized by signs of increased cerebral activity associated with alcohol-related compared with unrelated cues. Therefore, the results support the concept of cue-reactivity in alcoholism based on a neurobiological measurement. Future investigations will show whether this cue-reactivity can be applied to assess the risk of relapse in individual alcohol-dependent patients.",Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research,2000

ventral tegmentum","It has been shown that nicotine facilitates intracranial self- stimulation (ICSS) reward and that nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are of primary importance for its reinforcing and dependence-producing actions. Recently, we have shown that alpha7 nicotinic receptors in the VTA contribute to both the acute effects of nicotine on the mesolimbic dopamine system, as well as to nicotine withdrawal reactions. However, it is not yet known whether the same receptor conformation is directly involved in the reinforcing actions of nicotine. Here, using the curve-shift method we studied the effects of methyllycaconitine (MLA), a selective alpha7 receptor antagonist, microinjected (graded doses: 1, 3, 9 mug/mul per side) into the VTA on the rewarding efficacy of lateral hypothalamic self-stimulation and on the systemic nicotine-induced potentiation of brain stimulation reward. MLA did not affect baseline self-stimulation. Nicotine produced a significant reduction in ICSS threshold, without altering maximal rates of responding, while MLA attenuated the effect of nicotine at the two lower doses. Given the reported interaction between nicotine and cocaine at both the neuronal and the behavioral level, we also examined whether alpha7 receptor antagonism within the VTA can affect the reinforcing action of cocaine, as measured with ICSS. Interestingly, MLA attenuated the reinforcing effect of cocaine in all doses tested, without altering the maximal rate of responding, i.e. the performance of the animals. These results suggest that alpha7 nAChRs in the VTA are involved in mediating the reinforcing actions of drugs of abuse, such as nicotine and cocaine, and provide evidence that alpha7 nAChR antagonists may be clinically useful in attenuating the rewarding effects of addictive drugs.",Psychopharmacology,2000

rat","Previous data have shown that the repeated administration of kappa-opioid receptor agonists attenuates the acute behavioral effects of cocaine. The site and mechanism by which kappa-agonists interact with this psychostimulant, however, are unknown. Accordingly, the present microdialysis study characterized the effects of prior, repeated administration of the selective kappa-opioid receptor agonist U69593 on basal and cocaine-evoked DA levels within the nucleus accumbens (NAC) and caudate putamen (CPU). The influence of U69593 treatment on the locomotor-activating effects of an acute cocaine challenge was also assessed. Rats received once daily injections of U69593 (0.16-0.32 mg/kg/day) or vehicle (1.0 ml/kg/day) for 3 days. The behavioral and neurochemical effects produced by an acute cocaine challenge (20 mg/kg i.p.) were assessed 2 days following treatment cessation. Administration of cocaine to control animals increased locomotor activity. This effect was attenuated in animals which had previously received U69593 (0.32 mg/kg/day x 3 days). Prior administration of U69593 failed to modify basal DA levels in either the NAC or CPU. Thus, 2 days following the cessation of U69593 treatment, dialysate DA levels did not differ from that of controls. Administration of cocaine to vehicle-treated animals increased dialysate levels of DA in both brain regions. However, in animals previously exposed to U69593 (0.32 mg/kg/day x 3 days), a significant enhancement in the response of DA neurons to cocaine was seen. These data demonstrate that prior, repeated administration of a selective kappa-opioid receptor agonist attenuates the locomotor-activating effects of cocaine and increases cocaine-evoked DA overflow in terminal projection areas of mesostriatal and mesolimbic DA neurons. These findings indicate that the behavioral interactions of kappa- agonists with cocaine observed in this and previous studies cannot be attributed to a presynaptic inhibition of DA release. Rather, they suggest that postsynaptic or non-DA mechanisms mediate the interaction of these agents with cocaine.",Synapse,Nov-98

In this paper we examine upstream what could found this universal addictive principle, asking the question of the neurobiological root of addictivity. In other words, is the root of our brain working in an addictive way ? To answer affirmatively to this question we gather two sets of datas : firstly, the conditions of the brain addictivity and secondly, the brain mechanisms that suggest this kind of addictive working. These datas are common if we consider them one by one, but their synthesis in a bundle of heuristic clues could be interesting to examine and to submit to thought. The model we suggest proposes that the architecture of our brain and the type of functioning of our neurones, imply the presence of a natural addictive set of problems in all human beings, between a fight against cerebral background noise - a dysphoric source - and a stimulation need. Finally, considering some neurobiological data in the last five years, we propose a triangular model of the addict brain, that involves three associated systems: 'arousal' system, 'liking' system and 'wanting' system. This model, supported by the sensation seeking one, will allow us to suggest an explanation of the processes that lead to pathological addictions, according to the principles of a natural and universal addictivity.",Encephale,January/February 1998

Correlational support for this opioidergic theory of food cravings is provided by examining various clinical conditions (e.g. pregnancy, menstruation, bulimia, stress, depression) which are associated with altered EOP levels, intensified food cravings, and increased food intake.",Appetite,Dec-97

stress","There are many sources of reinforcement in the spectrum of cocaine dependence that contribute to the compulsive cocaine self-administration or loss of control of cocaine intake that constitutes the core of modern definitions of dependence. The development of withdrawal has long been considered an integral part of drug addiction but has lost its impact in the theorization of drug dependence because of new emphasis on the neurobiological substrates for the positive-reinforcing properties of drugs. The present treatise reviews the neurobiological substrates for the acute positive reinforcing effects of cocaine and what is beginning to be known about the neurobiological substrates of cocaine withdrawal. The concept of motivational or affective withdrawal is reintroduced, which reemphasizes opponent process theory as a model for the motivational effects of cocaine dependence. The same neural substrates hypothesized to be involved in the acute reinforcing properties of drugs (basal forebrain regions of nucleus accumbens and amygdala) are hypothesized to be altered during chronic drug treatment to produce the negative motivational states characterizing drug withdrawal. Within these brain regions, both the neurochemical system(s) on which the drug has its primary actions and other neurochemical systems may undergo adaptations to chronic presence of the drug. An understanding of the adaptations of the motivational systems of the brain accompanying cocaine dependence leads to important predictions not only about the etiology, treatment, and prevention of cocaine addiction but also about the vulnerability of these motivational systems in non-drug-induced psychopathology.",Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior,Jul-97

The probes were thought to-exert a distracting influence, especially on schizophrenics, and at the same time they generated auditory EPs which allowed to track the modulation of cortical excitability during response preparation. The midline distribution of the terminal contingent negative variation (tCNV) and the: amplitude of the postimperative negative variation (PINV) were clearly different in 20 DSM III-R schizophrenics, as compared with 20:alcoholics and 20 normal controls. In schizophrenics, the more frontal distribution of the tCNV was associated with a higher degree of psychopathology (measured with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale) and with delayed reactions. Probes between trials reduced tCNV and PINV in ail subjects alike. However, this effect could not be attributed to distraction, because reaction times were faster in these trials, possibly due to an alerting effect of the auditory probes. The N100 and P300 amplitudes to probes in the forewarning period, i.e.,:during the negative potential shift of the CNV, were significantly enhanced in all groups. Apparently there is a state of increased cortical excitability during the CNV which is not selectively 'tuned' toward relevant stimuli. In schizophrenia, the temporal and topographical regulation of this excitability is disturbed.",Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology,Feb-96

wernicke korsakoff syndrome","Objective: Although alcoholism is one of the most common psychiatric diagnoses, understanding of its pathophysiology remains poor. Accumulating evidence suggests that neurophysiological and pathological effects of ethanol are mediated to a considerable extent through the glutamatergic system. This article reviews the evidence for ethanol's effects on glutamatergic transmission and proposes a glutamatergic basis for alcoholism. Method(s): The information was derived from original research. The authors located more than 100 articles from psychiatry and neuroscience journals that related ethanol to glutamatergic transmission. They critically reviewed the neurobiology of the glutamatergic system in alcoholism and synthesized a unifying glutamatergic theory. Result(s): Acute effects of ethanol disrupt glutamatergic neurotransmission by inhibiting the response of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. Prolonged inhibition of the NMDA receptor by ethanol results in development of supersensitivity; acute removal of ethanol causes marked augmentation of activity of postsynaptic neurons, such as those in the noradrenergic system, and, in the extreme, glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. Neurobiological effects of alcoholism, such as intoxication, withdrawal seizures, delirium tremens, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, and fetal alcohol syndrome, can be understood as a spectrum of consequences of ethanol's effect on the glutamatergic system. Conclusion(s): A host of findings support the hypothesis that the unifying mechanism of action of ethanol is interference with glutamatergic neurotransmission, especially through the NMDA receptor. Alcoholism may be considered another member of the expanding family of glutamate-related neuropsychiatric disorders. These insights should increase understanding of the biologic vulnerabilities leading to ethanol abuse and dependence and aid development of more effective pharmacologic interventions.",American Journal of Psychiatry,Mar-95

Electrostimulation has been demonstrated as efficacious in both inpatient and outpatient settings; and, used appropriately, has no unwanted side-effects.

ventral tegmentum","Self-administered electrical brain-stimulation reward is one of the most powerful reinforcers known, rivalled only by the most intensely addicting drugs (e.g. cocaine). In humans, such stimulation produces intense pleasure or euphoria. The brain systems subserving this reward apparently consist of synaptically interconnected neurons associated with the medial forebrain bundle (MFB). 'First-stage' neurons run caudally within the MFB, and synapse in the ventral tegmental area on 'second-stage' dopaminergic neurons running rostrally within the MFB, which are preferentially activated by habit-forming drugs, and which synapse in the nucleus accumbens on 'third-stage' endogenous opioid peptide neurons. Many other types of neurons synapse onto this reward circuit to regulate hedonic tone. Also, this reward circuit is strongly implicated in the pleasures produced by natural rewards (e.g. food, sex). It is widely assumed that craving is mediated by these same circuits. Some theories posit that craving results from neurotransmitter (dopamine) depletion within the reward circuitry. Other theories posit that 'opponent-process' neural systems exist within the reward circuitry, mediating both positive and negative hedonic processes. In this view, craving results from functional dominance of neural systems mediating negative hedonic tone over those mediating positive hedonic tone. It is suggested that current neurophysiological, neurochemical, neuropharmacological and neuro-behavioral data appear to favor this latter view of the neurobiology of craving. It is further suggested that multiple craving states exist, with multiple neurotransmitter substrates. If true, such facts would imply that anti-drug-craving medication development programs predicated on a simple 'hypo-dopaminergic' concept of drug craving have little chance of success.",Seminars in the Neurosciences,1993

Among 89 outpatients complaining of chronic insomnia and receiving a heavy hypnotic drug treatment, an efficient withdrawal associated with a marked improvement of self-reported sleep was observed in 78% of cases, especially when insomnia was not related to medical aetiologies or to major psychiatric disorders. These results suggest further controlled studies to determine the magnitude of the placebo component in the effect observed.",Encephale,1990

*schizophrenia","The experiments clearly indicate that morphine increases the sensitivity of animals to rewarding brain stimulation and suggest that brain-stimulation reward may be a useful model for understanding the rewarding effects of the opiate drugs. Naloxone's ability to attentuate the threshold-lowering effect of amphetamine, cocaine, and PCP and to potentiate the threshold-raising effect of chlorpromazine suggests that there is an important interaction between the catecholiminergic and endorphinergic systems. Finally, this interaction may have relevance for the clinical use of naloxone with neuroleptics in the treatment of schizophrenic patients.",Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,1982

therapy","A 48-year-old woman with a stimulating electrode implanted in the right thalamic nucleus ventralis posterolateralis developed compulsive self-stimulation associated with erotic sensations and changes in autonomic and neurologic function. Stimulation effects were evaluated by neuropsychologic testing, endocrine studies, positron emission tomographic measurements of regional cerebral metabolic rate for glucose, EEG and evoked potentials. During stimulation, vital signs and pupillary diameter increased and a left hemiparesis and left hemisensory loss developed. Verbal functions deteriorated and visuospatial processing improved. Plasma growth hormone concentrations decreased, and adrenocorticotrophic hormone and cortisol levels rose. With stimulation, glucose metabolism increased in both thalami and both hemispheres, reversing baseline right-sided hypometabolism and right-left asymmetries. EEG and both somatosensory and brain-stem auditory evoked potentials remained unchanged during stimulation, while visual evoked potentials revealed evidence of anterior visual pathway dysfunction in the left eye. This case establishes the potential for addiction to deep brain stimulation and demonstrates that widespread behavioral and physiological changes, with concomitant alteration in the regional cerebral metabolic rate for glucose, may accompany unilateral thalamic stimulation.",Pain,1986

therapy","Sixty physicians and other health-care professionals with narcotic dependency were treated with naltrexone, 300 to 350 mg/week, in private physician's offices. Patients remained on naltrexone treatment for an average of 8 months. On a global scale rating the degree of improvement in drug abuse, professional activities, and psychosocial adjustment, 29 patients were rated much improved and 31 either moderately or slightly improved. When these two groups were compared, it was found that more patients in the much improved group did not drink (p < .01) and remained in naltrexone treatment longer than 6 months (p < .01). Patients in the much improved group were also older (p < .01). Naltrexone, used in the private practice setting, appears to be a useful treatment adjunct for addicted health-care professionals.",Journal of Clinical Psychiatry,1984
