Outcomes from randomized clinical trials have shown that cognitive function improved in some patients but deteriorated in others. One reason could be variance in electrode placement leading to differential engagement of neural circuits. To investigate this, we analyzed a multi-center cohort of 46 patients with DBS to the fornix. Using normative structural and functional connectivity data, we demonstrate that stimulation of the circuit of Papez and stria terminalis robustly associated with cognitive improvement (R = 0.45, p = 0.031). On a local level, the optimal stimulation site resided at the direct interface between these structures (R = 0.33, p = 0.016). Finally, modulating specific distributed brain networks related to memory accounted for optimal outcomes (R = 0.38, p = 0.006). Findings were robust to multiple cross-validation designs and may now define an optimal network target which could subsequently guide refinement of DBS surgery and programming.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale [m]","Background: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an established treatment for disabling motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) that persist despite optimal pharmacological treatment. Currently, DBS is not performed if there is concomitant significant cognitive impairment based on concerns of cognitive deterioration, higher complication rate and less functional improvement. However, this has not been investigated so far. Method(s): A single center, prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded end-point (PROBE design) pilot clinical trial is being performed. Patients are eligible for the trial if they have PD dementia (PDD), are able to provide informed consent, and experience disabling motor response fluctuations, bradykinesia, dyskinesia, or painful dystonia, despite optimal pharmacological treatment. In total 44 patients will be randomized to either STN-DBS accompanied by best medical treatment (DBS group) or to best medical treatment alone (BMT group). The primary outcome measure is the change from baseline to 30 weeks on the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III score in a standardized off-drug phase. The main secondary outcome measures consist of scales assessing cognitive aspects of daily living, neuropsychiatric symptoms and impulsive compulsive disorders. Additional secondary outcome measures include motor signs during on-drug phase, dyskinesia, motor fluctuations, cognitive performance, (severe) adverse events, treatment satisfaction, and caregiver burden. Patients will be followed during 52 weeks after randomization. Discussion(s): The Deep Brain Stimulation for MOtor symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease DEmentia (DBS-MODE) trial directly compares the effectiveness and safety of DBS with BMT in patients with PDD. Trial registration: The DBS-MODE trial has been registered in the International Clinical Trial Registry Platform (NL9361) on the 24th of March 2021 (https://trialsearch.who.int/Trial2.aspx?TrialID=NL9361).Copyright Â© 2023, The Author(s).",BMC Neurology,Dec-23,,"Background: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an established treatment for disabling motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) that persist despite optimal pharmacological treatment.

Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale","Background: Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) is an effective treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD). The long-term benefit in PD patients with STN-DBS in comparison to medical treatment (MT) alone has not yet been demonstrated conclusively. Objective(s): To judge the long-term outcome of patients with STN-DBS. Method(s): To assess the evolution of PD symptoms and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) after deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery, we conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 115 patients with STN-DBS with rater-based scales and self-reported questionnaires. In addition, we screened records of all our STN-DBS patients (2001-2019, n = 162 patients) for the onset of the morbidity milestones (falls, hallucinations, dementia, and nursing home placement) to assess disability-free life expectancy. Result(s): In the first year of STN-DBS, levodopa equivalent dose was reduced and motor function improved. Nonmotor symptoms and cognition remained stable. These effects were similar to previous studies. Morbidity milestones occurred 13 +/- 7 years after diagnosis. Motor function, cognition, and HRQoL significantly worsened after the occurrence of any milestone, confirming the clinical relevance of these milestones. After onset of the first milestone, mean survival time was limited to 5 +/- 0.8 years, which is comparable with patients with PD but without STN-DBS. Conclusion(s): On average, PD patients with STN-DBS live with their disease for a longer time, and morbidity milestones occur later in the disease course than in PD patients with MT. As judged by morbidity milestones, morbidity remains compressed into the final 5 years of life in PD patients with STN-DBS.Copyright Â© 2023 The Authors.

A trend in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is targeting key points of neural circuits with DBS. Here, we explored the effects of DBS targeted to the entorhinal cortex (EC) on neurons in the hippocampal CA1 in a mouse model of preclinical AD. Specifically, we recorded field potential signals from CA1 in preclinical AD mice after DBS of the EC (1 h/day for 21 days of 100 muA, 90 mus, 10 Hz, biphasic square wave pulse) with in-vivo electrophysiology and evaluated corresponding changes in behavior with the open field task and Morris water maze (MWM) task. We also assessed changes in pathological markers and neurogenesis in the hippocampus with immunohistological staining. DBS of the EC increased theta and gamma power and modulated theta in the high gamma band (50-100 Hz) in preclinical AD mice. After DBS of the EC, these mice performed better in the MWM task and exhibited reduced deposition of beta-amyloid and neuronal changes including significant increases in proliferating neurons and immature neurons. This is the first study to target the EC with DBS and analyze resulting neural oscillations in the hippocampal CA1 in a model of preclinical AD. The findings support the use of DBS as a potential treatment for AD.Copyright Â© 2023 The Authors",Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering,01-Jan-23,"amyloid beta protein / endogenous compound

The objectives of the present study were to determine whether motor symptom asymmetry in Parkinson's disease is one such risk factor and to identify predictors of subnormal cognitive decline. METHOD(S): A total of 26 patients receiving STN-DBS (13 with left-sided motor symptoms and 13 with right-sided ones) underwent follow-up neuropsychological, depression and apathy assessments over a 5-year period. Nonparametric intergroup comparisons were performed on raw scores, as well as Cox regression analyses on standardized Mattis Dementia Rating Scale scores. RESULT(S): Compared with patients who had predominantly left-sided symptoms, right-sided patients scored higher on both apathy (at 3 months and 36 months) and depressive symptoms (at 6 months and 12 months) and scored lower on global cognitive efficiency (at 36 months and 60 months). Survival analyses revealed that only right-sided patients had subnormal standardized dementia scores, which were negatively associated with the number of perseverations in the Wisconsin Card Scoring Test. CONCLUSION(S): Right-sided motor symptoms are a risk factor for more severe short- and long-term cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms following STN-DBS, confirming literature findings on left hemispheric vulnerability.Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2023.

*subthalamic nucleus","Introduction: Dementia in Parkinson's disease (PDD) is a common non-motor symptom of advanced disease, associated with pronounced neocortical cholinergic deficits due to neurodegeneration of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) and its cholinergic terminals. In advanced PD, patients often require advanced therapies such as infusion therapy or deep brain stimulation (DBS) to improve motor control. However, patients with associated dementia are commonly excluded from DBS because of potential deterioration of cognitive functions. Yet marked reductions in dopaminergic medication and the subsequent risk of side effects (e.g., cognitive decline, psychosis, delirium) suggest that critical re-consideration of DBS of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) for advanced stages of PD and PDD is worthwhile. In this Phase 1b study, we will provide STN-DBS to a cohort of PDD patients with severe motor fluctuations and combine two additional electrodes for augmentative neurostimulation of the NBM. Method(s): We aim to include 12 patients with mild-to-moderately severe PDD who fulfill indication criteria regarding motor symptoms for STN-DBS. Eligible patients will undergo implantation of a neurostimulation system with bilateral electrodes in both the STN and NBM. After 12 weeks of STN-DBS (visit 1/V1), participants will be randomized to receive either effective neurostimulation of the NBM (group 1) or sham stimulation of the NBM (group 2). NBM-DBS will be activated in all participants after 24 weeks of blinded treatment (visit 2/V2). The primary outcome will be the safety of combined bilateral STN- and NBM-DBS, determined by spontaneously-reported adverse events. Other outcome measures will comprise changes on scales evaluating cognition, activities of daily living functioning and clinical global impression, as well as motor functions, mood, behavior, caregiver burden and health economic aspects, and several domain-specific cognitive tests. Changes in scores (V1 - V2) for both treatment arms will undergo analysis of covariances, with baseline scores as covariates. Perspective(s): The feasibility and safety of combined STN-NBM-DBS in patients with PDD will be assessed to determine whether additional NBM-DBS improves or slows the progression of cognitive decline. Positive results would provide a basic concept for future studies evaluating the efficacy of NBM-DBS in larger PDD cohorts. Indirectly, proof-of-safety of STN-DBS in PDD might influence patient selection for this standard treatment option in advanced PD.

The precise neural substrates and circuitry subserving these responses, however, are poorly characterized to date. We sought to retrospectively explore the acute sequalae of hypothalamic region deep brain stimulation and characterize their neuroanatomical correlates. To this end we studied at multiple international centers 58 patients (mean age: 68.5 +/- 7.9 years, 26 females) suffering from mild Alzheimer's disease who underwent stimulation of the fornix region between 2007 and 2019. We catalogued the diverse spectrum of acutely induced clinical responses during electrical stimulation and interrogated their neural substrates using volume of tissue activated modelling, voxel-wise mapping, and supervised machine learning techniques. In total 627 acute clinical responses to stimulation - including tachycardia, hypertension, flushing, sweating, warmth, coldness, nausea, phosphenes, and fear - were recorded and catalogued across patients using standard descriptive methods. The most common manifestations during hypothalamic region stimulation were tachycardia (30.9%) and warmth (24.6%) followed by flushing (9.1%) and hypertension (6.9%). Voxel-wise mapping identified distinct, locally separable clusters for all sequelae that could be mapped to specific hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic gray- and white-matter structures. K-nearest neighbor classification further validated the clinico-anatomical correlates emphasizing the functional importance of identified neural substrates with area under the receiving operating characteristic curves (AUROC) between 0.67 - 0.91.

Deep brain stimulation of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM DBS) has been proposed as a potential new treatment option in dementias. OBJECTIVE(S): To assess the safety and tolerability of low frequency (20 Hz) NBM DBS in DLB patients and explore its potential effects on both clinical symptoms and functional connectivity in underlying cognitive networks. METHOD(S): We conducted an exploratory randomised, double-blind, crossover trial of NBM DBS in six DLB patients recruited from two UK neuroscience centres. Patients were aged between 50-80 years, had mild-moderate dementia symptoms and were living with a carer-informant. Patients underwent image guided stereotactic implantation of bilateral DBS electrodes with the deepest contacts positioned in the Ch4i subsector of NBM. Patients were subsequently assigned to receive either active or sham stimulation for six weeks, followed by a two week washout period, then the opposite condition for six weeks. Safety and tolerability of both the surgery and stimulation were systematically evaluated throughout. Exploratory outcomes included the difference in scores on standardised measurements of cognitive, psychiatric and motor symptoms between the active and sham stimulation conditions, as well as differences in functional connectivity in discrete cognitive networks on resting state fMRI. RESULT(S): Surgery and stimulation were well tolerated by all six patients (five male, mean age 71.33 years). One serious adverse event occurred: one patient developed antibiotic-associated colitis, prolonging his hospital stay by two weeks. No consistent improvements were observed in exploratory clinical outcome measures, but the severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms reduced with NBM DBS in 3/5 patients. Active stimulation was associated with functional connectivity changes in both the default mode network and the frontoparietal network. CONCLUSION(S): Low frequency NBM DBS can be safely conducted in DLB patients. This should encourage further exploration of the possible effects of stimulation on neuropsychiatric symptoms and corresponding changes in functional connectivity in cognitive networks.

Safety and tolerability of both the surgery and stimulation were systematically evaluated throughout. Exploratory outcomes included the difference in scores on standardised measurements of cognitive, psychiatric and motor symptoms between the active and sham stimulation conditions, as well as differences in functional connectivity in discrete cognitive networks on resting state fMRI. RESULT(S): Surgery and stimulation were well tolerated by all six patients (five male, mean age 71.33 years). One serious adverse event occurred: one patient developed antibiotic-associated colitis, prolonging his hospital stay by two weeks. No consistent improvements were observed in exploratory clinical outcome measures, but the severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms reduced with NBM DBS in 3/5 patients. Active stimulation was associated with functional connectivity changes in both the default mode network and the frontoparietal network. CONCLUSION(S): Low frequency NBM DBS can be safely conducted in DLB patients. This should encourage further exploration of the possible effects of stimulation on neuropsychiatric symptoms and corresponding changes in functional connectivity in cognitive networks.

stria terminalis","Deep brain stimulation (DBS) to the fornix is an investigational treatment for patients with mild Alzheimer's Disease. Outcomes from randomized clinical trials have shown that cognitive function improved in some patients but deteriorated in others. This could be explained by variance in electrode placement leading to differential engagement of neural circuits. To investigate this, we performed a post-hoc analysis on a multi-center cohort of 46 patients with DBS to the fornix (NCT00658125, NCT01608061). Using normative structural and functional connectivity data, we found that stimulation of the circuit of Papez and stria terminalis robustly associated with cognitive improvement (R = 0.53, p < 0.001). On a local level, the optimal stimulation site resided at the direct interface between these structures (R = 0.48, p < 0.001). Finally, modulating specific distributed brain networks related to memory accounted for optimal outcomes (R = 0.48, p < 0.001). Findings were robust to multiple cross-validation designs and may define an optimal network target that could refine DBS surgery and programming.Copyright Â© 2022, The Author(s).",Nature Communications,Dec-22,,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) to the fornix is an investigational treatment for patients with mild Alzheimer's Disease.

However, there is little evidence of whether NBM-DBS can improve cognitive functioning in patients with advanced AD. In addition, the mechanisms underlying the modulation of brain networks remain unclear. This study was aimed to assess the cognitive function and the resting-state connectivity following NBM-DBS in patients with advanced AD. Method(s): Eight patients with advanced AD underwent bilateral NBM-DBS and were followed up for 12 months. Clinical outcomes were assessed by neuropsychological examinations using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography data were also collected. Result(s): The cognitive functioning of AD patients did not change from baseline to the 12-month follow-up. Interestingly, the MMSE score indicated clinical efficacy at 1 month of follow-up. At this time point, the connectivity between the hippocampal network and frontoparietal network tended to increase in the DBS-on state compared to the DBS-off state. Additionally, the increased functional connectivity between the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG) and the parietal cortex was associated with cognitive improvement. Further dynamic functional network analysis showed that NBM-DBS increased the proportion of the PHG-related connections, which was related to improved cognitive performance. Conclusion(s): The results indicated that NBM-DBS improves short-term cognitive performance in patients with advanced AD, which may be related to the modulation of multi-network connectivity patterns, and the hippocampus plays an important role within these networks.Copyright Â© 2022, The Author(s).",Translational Neurodegeneration,Dec-22,"aniracetam / drug therapy / special situation for pharmacovigilance

Wechsler memory scale","Background: Current treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD) modulate global neurotransmission but are neither specific nor anatomically directed. Tailored stimulation of target nuclei will increase treatment efficacy while reducing side effects. We report the results of the first directional deep brain stimulation (dDBS) surgery and treatment of a patient with AD in an attempt to slow the progression of the disease in a woman with multi-domain, amnestic cognitive status. Method(s): We aimed to assess the safety of dDBS in patients with AD using the fornix as stimulation target (primary objective) and the clinical impact of the stimulation (secondary objective). In a registered clinical trial, a female patient aged 81 years with a 2-year history of cognitive decline and diagnoses of AD underwent a bilateral dDBS surgery targeting the fornix. Stimulation parameters were set between 3.9 and 7.5 mA, 90 mus, 130 Hz for 24 months, controlling stimulation effects by 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG) scans (baseline, 12 and 24 months), magnetoencephalography (MEG) and clinical/neuropsychological assessment (baseline, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months). Result(s): There were no important complications related to the procedure. In general terms, the patient showed cognitive fluctuations over the period, related to attention and executive function patterns, with no meaningful changes in any other cognitive functions, as is shown in the clinical dementia rating scale (CDR = 1) scores over the 24 months. Such stability in neuropsychological scores corresponds to the stability of the brain metabolic function, seen in PET scans. The MEG studies described low functional connectivity at baseline and a subsequent increase in the number of significant connections, mainly in the theta band, at 12 months. Conclusion(s): The dDBS stimulation in the fornix seems to be a safe treatment for patients in the first stage of AD. Effects on cognition seem to be mild to moderate during the first months of stimulation and return to baseline levels after 24 months, except for verbal fluency.

In particular, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are leading neurodegenerative diseases. To aid their diagnosis and optimize treatment, we have developed a classification algorithm for AD to manipulate magnetic resonance images (MRI) stored in a large database of patients, containing 1,200 images. The algorithm can predict whether a patient is healthy, has mild cognitive impairment, or already has AD. We then applied this classification algorithm to therapeutic outcomes in PD after treatment with deep brain stimulation (DBS), to assess which stereotactic variables were the most important to consider when performing surgery in this indication. Here, we describe the stereotactic system used for DBS procedures, and compare different planning methods with the gold standard normally used (i.e., neurophysiological coordinates recorded intraoperatively). We used information collected from database of 72 DBS electrodes implanted in PD patients, and assessed the potentially most beneficial ranges of deviation within planning and neurophysiological coordinates from the operating room, to provide neurosurgeons with additional landmarks that may help to optimize outcomes: we observed that x coordinate deviation within CT scan and gold standard intra-operative neurophysiological coordinates is a robust matric to pre-assess positive therapy outcomes- ""good therapy"" prediction if deviation is higher than 2.5 mm.

In this work, we develop a modified thalamo-cortico-thalamic (TCT) model associated with AD to explore the therapeutic effects of DBS on AD from the perspective of neurocomputation. First, the neuropathological state of AD resulting from synapse loss is mimicked by decreasing the synaptic connectivity strength from the Inter-Neurons (IN) neuron population to the Thalamic Relay Cells (TRC) neuron population. Under such AD condition, a specific deep brain stimulation voltage is then implanted into the neural nucleus of TRC in this TCT model. The symptom of AD is found significantly relieved by means of power spectrum analysis and nonlinear dynamical analysis. Furthermore, the therapeutic effects of DBS on AD are systematically examined in different parameter space of DBS. The results demonstrate that the controlling effect of DBS on AD can be efficient by appropriately tuning the key parameters of DBS including amplitude A, period P and duration D. This work highlights the critical role of thalamus stimulation for brain disease, and provides a theoretical basis for future experimental and clinical studies in treating AD.Â© Copyright Â© 2021 Yang, Zhang, Sun and Kurths.",Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience,08-Nov-21,,"Experimental and clinical studies have shown that the technique of deep brain stimulation (DBS) plays a potential role in the regulation of Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet it still desires for ongoing studies including clinical trials, theoretical approach and action mechanism.

The precise neural substrates and circuitry subserving these responses, however, are poorly characterized to date. We sought to retrospectively explore the acute sequelae of hypothalamic region deep brain stimulation and characterize their neuroanatomical correlates. To this end we studied-at multiple international centres-58 patients (mean age: 68.5 +/- 7.9 years, 26 females) suffering from mild Alzheimer's disease who underwent stimulation of the fornix region between 2007 and 2019. We catalogued the diverse spectrum of acutely induced clinical responses during electrical stimulation and interrogated their neural substrates using volume of tissue activated modelling, voxel-wise mapping, and supervised machine learning techniques. In total 627 acute clinical responses to stimulation-including tachycardia, hypertension, flushing, sweating, warmth, coldness, nausea, phosphenes, and fear-were recorded and catalogued across patients using standard descriptive methods. The most common manifestations during hypothalamic region stimulation were tachycardia (30.9%) and warmth (24.6%) followed by flushing (9.1%) and hypertension (6.9%). Voxel-wise mapping identified distinct, locally separable clusters for all sequelae that could be mapped to specific hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic grey and white matter structures. K-nearest neighbour classification further validated the clinico-anatomical correlates emphasizing the functional importance of identified neural substrates with area under the receiving operating characteristic curves between 0.67 and 0.91. Overall, we were able to localize acute effects of hypothalamic region stimulation to distinct tracts and nuclei within the hypothalamus and the wider diencephalon providing clinico-anatomical insights that may help to guide future neuromodulation work.Copyright Â© 2021 Oxford University Press.

The cohort was split into a subset of 213 BSD-PD patients, compared with 426 matched PD patients without BSDs, and a subset of 34 BSD-PD and 79 PD patients carrying GBA or PRKN mutations. Carriers of mutations absent in BSD-PD patients and of synuclein triplication were excluded. Structured clinical interviews and mood disorder questionnaires assessed BSDs. Linear mixed models evaluated the assessment scales over time. Thirteen BSD-PD patients underwent subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) and were compared with 27 matched STN-DBS-treated PD patients. Result(s): Compared to PD patients, BSD-PD showed (1) higher frequency of family history of PD (odds ratio [OR] 3.31; 2.32-4.71) and BSDs (OR 6.20; 4.11-9.35) 5); (2) higher incidence of impulse control disorders (hazard ratio [HR] 5.95, 3.89-9.09); (3) higher frequency of functional disorders occurring before PD therapy (HR, 5.67, 3.95-8.15); (4) earlier occurrence of delusions or mild dementia (HR, 7.70, 5.55-10.69; HR, 1.43, 1.16-1.75); and (5) earlier mortality (1.48; 1.11-1.97).

Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) has been used to treat PD for more than 2 decades, but few studies exist concerning mortality in this subset of patients. Our goal is to analyse mortality in PD patients treated with DBS in our centre. Method(s): retrospective evaluation of clinical files of patients with PD who underwent DBS surgery consecutively between October 2002 and May 2019. Result(s): 346 patients were included in the analysis, 60 % male, with a mean age at disease onset of 48+/- 8 years (18-64), mean age at surgery of 60 +/- 7 years (33-75), and mean disease duration until surgery of 14 +/- 6 years (3-52). Mean follow-up after surgery was 7 +/- 4 years (range 1-17). Overall mortality rate was 17.9 % and mean age at time of death was 71 +/- 6 years. The main causes of death were pneumonia, dementia and acute myocardial infarction. In our series, male gender and disease duration until surgery were the only predictors of mortality in multivariate analysis. Conclusion(s): Our study showed a long-term survival higher than previously described, and suggests that the treatment of patients with shorter disease evolution might have a survival benefit. The leading causes of death in PD patients treated with DBS seems unrelated to surgery, as the main causes of death are comparable to non-DBS patients.Copyright Â© 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Clinical Neurology and Neurosurgery,Mar-21,levodopa / drug therapy,"Introduction: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder, with a higher risk of death than general population.

The leading causes of death in PD patients treated with DBS seems unrelated to surgery, as the main causes of death are comparable to non-DBS patients.","[[""The title/abstract implies that it is a review paper or meta-analysis"", ""No"", ""The abstract does not mention that it is a review paper or meta-analysis.""], [""The title/abstract implies that the study produced original data"", ""Yes"", ""The abstract mentions that the study is a retrospective evaluation of clinical files, indicating that it produced original data.""], [""The study investigates deep brain stimulation as a treatment for a condition"", ""Yes"", ""The abstract specifically mentions that the study investigates deep brain stimulation as a treatment for Parkinson's disease.""], [""The study investigates transcranial direct current or magnetic stimulation as a treatment for a condition"", ""No"", ""The abstract does not mention transcranial direct current or magnetic stimulation as treatments.""], [""The study investigates treatment for neurodegenerative disorders"", ""Yes"", ""The abstract mentions that the study investigates treatment for Parkinson's disease, which is a neurodegenerative disorder.""], [""The study investigates treatment for dementia"", ""Yes"", ""The abstract mentions that dementia is one of the main causes of death in the study population.""], [""The study investigates treatment for Alzheimer's disease"", ""No"", ""The abstract does not mention treatment for Alzheimer's disease.""], [""The study reports on a measure of clinical outcome after treatment"", ""Yes"", ""The abstract reports on mortality rate, age at time of death, and the main causes of death, which are measures of clinical outcome after treatment.""]]","[false, true, true, false, true, true, false, true]",FALSE,No,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,TRUE

Here, we aim to assess the safety and effects of NBM-DBS in patients with Lewy body dementia (LBD), in a randomized, double-blind, crossover clinical trial. METHOD(S): Six patients with mild to moderate LBD (mean [SD] age, 62.2 [7.8] years) were included, operated on for bilateral NBM-DBS, and assigned to receive either active or sham NBM-DBS followed by the opposite condition for 3 months. The primary outcome was the difference in the total free recalls of the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT) between active and sham NBM-DBS. Secondary outcomes were assessments of the safety and effects of NBM-DBS on cognition, motor disability, sleep, and PET imaging. RESULT(S): There was no significant difference in the FCSRT score with active vs sham NBM-DBS. The surgical procedures were well tolerated in all patients, but we observed significant decreases in Stroop and Benton scores after electrode implantation. We observed no significant difference in other scales between active and sham NBM-DBS. With active NBM-DBS relative to baseline, phonemic fluency and motor disability significantly decreased. Lastly, the superior lingual gyrus metabolic activity significantly increased with active NBM-DBS. CONCLUSION(S): NBM-DBS does not appear to be totally safe for patients with LBD with no evidence of cognitive benefit. CLINICALTRIALSGOV IDENTIFIER: NCT01340001.

stereotaxic surgery","Background: Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second most common form of dementia. Current symptomatic treatment with medications remains inadequate. Deep brain stimulation of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM DBS) has been proposed as a potential new treatment option in dementias. Objective(s): To assess the safety and tolerability of low frequency (20 Hz) NBM DBS in DLB patients and explore its potential effects on both clinical symptoms and functional connectivity in underlying cognitive networks. Method(s): We conducted an exploratory randomised, double-blind, crossover trial of NBM DBS in six DLB patients recruited from two UK neuroscience centres. Patients were aged between 50 and 80 years, had mild-moderate dementia symptoms and were living with a carer-informant. Patients underwent image guided stereotactic implantation of bilateral DBS electrodes with the deepest contacts positioned in the Ch4i subsector of NBM. Patients were subsequently assigned to receive either active or sham stimulation for six weeks, followed by a two week washout period, then the opposite condition for six weeks. Safety and tolerability of both the surgery and stimulation were systematically evaluated throughout. Exploratory outcomes included the difference in scores on standardised measurements of cognitive, psychiatric and motor symptoms between the active and sham stimulation conditions, as well as differences in functional connectivity in discrete cognitive networks on resting state fMRI. Result(s): Surgery and stimulation were well tolerated by all six patients (five male, mean age 71.33 years). One serious adverse event occurred: one patient developed antibiotic-associated colitis, prolonging his hospital stay by two weeks. No consistent improvements were observed in exploratory clinical outcome measures, but the severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms reduced with NBM DBS in 3/5 patients. Active stimulation was associated with functional connectivity changes in both the default mode network and the frontoparietal network. Conclusion(s): Low frequency NBM DBS can be safely conducted in DLB patients. This should encourage further exploration of the possible effects of stimulation on neuropsychiatric symptoms and corresponding changes in functional connectivity in cognitive networks.

Preoperative and perioperative risk factors of developing postoperative dementia were also investigated. Demographic data, disease features, medications, comorbidities, nonmotor symptoms, PD motor scales, neuropsychological scales at baseline, and perioperative complications were collected for each patient.ResultsA total of 175 patients were included, and 104 were available at 10-year follow-up. Dementia prevalence was 2.3% at 1 year, 8.5% at 5 years, and 29.8% at 10 years. Dementia cumulative incidence at 1, 5, and 10 years was 2.3%, 10.9%, and 25.7%, respectively. The corresponding dementia incidence rate was 35.6 per 1,000 person-years. Male sex, higher age, hallucinations, lower frontal score at baseline, and perioperative cerebral hemorrhage were predictors of dementia.ConclusionsIn patients with PD with longstanding STN-DBS, dementia prevalence and incidence are not higher than those reported in the general PD population. Except for few patients with perioperative cerebral hemorrhage, STN-DBS is cognitively safe, and does not provide dementia risk factors in addition to those reported for PD itself.

Previous studies on mild to moderate AD patients demonstrated improvements in cognitive functions brought about by forniceal DBS. Here, we report our longitudinal findings in one severe AD patient for whom the activities of daily living (ADL) rather than cognitive function significantly improved after 3 mo of continuous stimulation. CASE SUMMARY In 2011, a 62-year-old Chinese male with no previous history of brain injury or other neuropsychological diseases and no family history of dementia developed early symptoms of memory decline and cognitive impairment. Five years later, the symptoms had increased to the extent that they affected his daily living. He lost the ability to work as a businessman and to take care of himself. The patient was given a clinical diagnosis of probable AD and was prescribed donepezil and subsequently memantine, but no improvement in symptoms was observed. The patient then received DBS surgery. After 3 mo of continuous stimulation, the patient's ADL score decreased from 65 points to 47 points, indicating the quality of the patient's daily living improved distinctly. Other scores remained unchanged, suggesting no significant improvement in cognitive function. A follow-up positron emission tomography scan demonstrated perceivable increased glucose metabolism in the classical AD-related brain regions. CONCLUSION Based on this case we hypothesize that forniceal DBS may improve ADL through elevating regional glucose metabolism in the brain.Copyright Â© 2020",World Journal of Clinical Cases,26-Oct-20,"amyloid beta protein[1-42]

Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale","Objectives: Based on multi-domain classification of Parkinson disease (PD) subtypes, we sought to determine the key features that best differentiate subtypes and the utility of PD subtypes to predict clinical milestones. Method(s): Prospective cohort of 162 PD participants with ongoing, longitudinal follow-up. Latent class analysis (LCA) delineated subtypes based on score patterns across baseline motor, cognitive, and psychiatric measures. Discriminant analyses identified key features that distinguish subtypes at baseline. Cox regression models tested PD subtype differences in longitudinal conversion to clinical milestones, including deep brain stimulation (DBS), dementia, and mortality. Result(s): LCA identified distinct subtypes: ""motor only"" (N = 63) characterized by primary motor deficits; ""psychiatric & motor"" (N = 17) characterized by prominent psychiatric symptoms and moderate motor deficits; ""cognitive & motor"" (N = 82) characterized by impaired cognition and moderate motor deficits. Depression, executive function, and apathy best discriminated subtypes. Since enrollment, 22 had DBS, 48 developed dementia, and 46 have died. Although there were no subtype differences in rate of DBS, dementia occurred at a higher rate in the ""cognitive & motor"" subtype. Surprisingly, mortality risk was similarly elevated for both ""cognitive & motor"" and ""psychiatric & motor"" subtypes compared to the ""motor only"" subtype (relative risk = 3.15, 2.60). Interpretation(s): Psychiatric and cognitive features, rather than motor deficits, distinguish clinical PD subtypes and predict greater risk of subsequent dementia and mortality. These results emphasize the value of multi-domain assessments to better characterize clinical variability in PD. Further, differences in dementia and mortality rates demonstrate the prognostic utility of PD subtypes.Copyright Â© 2020 The Authors.

Moreover, it is unclear whether PD with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) or domain-specific cognitive impairments affect the outcome of DBS in non-demented PD patients. Objective(s): To investigate the influence of baseline cognitive profiles of PD on the outcome of DBS. Method(s): Baseline cognitive levels of patients with PD who underwent DBS were classified into PD with dementia (PDD) (n = 15), PD-MCI (n = 210), and normal cognition (PD-NC) (n = 79). The impact of the cognitive level on key DBS outcome measures [mortality, nursing home admission, progression to Hoehn&Yahr (HY) stage 5 and progression to PDD] were analyzed using Cox regression models. We also investigated whether impairment of a specific cognitive domain could predict these outcomes in non-demented patients. Result(s): Patients with PDD showed a substantially higher risk of nursing home admission and progression to HY stage 5 compared with patients with PD-MCI [hazard ratio (HR) 4.20, P =.002; HR = 5.29, P <.001] and PD-NC (HR 7.50, P <.001; HR = 7.93, P <.001).

Objective(s): We compared the rates of dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), urinary incontinence, nocturia, falls, hospitalizations, and mortality in a cohort of PD patients undergoing DBS with a cohort of medically-treated patients chosen as controls. Method(s): We conducted a retrospective pilot study in six Italian DBS centers. 91 PD patients receiving DBS and 91 age- and gender-matched controls receiving the best medical treatment alone with a minimum follow-up of one year were enrolled. Clinical data were collected from baseline to the last follow-up visit using an ad-hoc developed web-based system. Result(s): The risk of dementia was similar in the two groups while patients in the surgical cohort had lower rates of MCI, urinary incontinence, nocturia, and falls. In contrast, the risk of hospital admissions related to PD was higher in the surgical cohort. However, when excluding hospitalizations related to DBS surgery, the difference between the two cohorts was not significant. The surgical cohort had a lower number of hospitalizations not related to PD. The risk of death was similar in the two groups. Conclusion(s): Despite a higher risk of hospitalization, patients receiving DBS had a lower rate of MCI, urinary incontinence, nocturia and falls, without evidence of an increased risk of dementia and mortality. Although these findings need to be confirmed in prospective studies, they seem to suggest that DBS may play a significant role in the management of non-motor symptoms and common complications of advanced PD.Copyright Â© 2019",Journal of the Neurological Sciences,15-Oct-19,,"Background: The impact of deep brain stimulation (DBS) on cognitive and urinary disorders, falls, and eventually hospitalizations and mortality in Parkinson's disease (PD) is still debated.

Disturbances of the dopaminergic system can cause deficient PPI as found in neuropsychiatric diseases. A target specific influence of deep brain stimulation (DBS) on PPI has been shown in animal models of neuropsychiatric disorders. In the present study, three patients with early dementia of Alzheimer type underwent DBS of the median forebrain bundle (MFB) in a compassionate use program to maintain cognitive abilities. This provided us the unique possibility to investigate the effects of different stimulation conditions of DBS of the MFB on PPI in humans. Result(s): Separate analysis of each patient consistently showed a frequency dependent pattern with a DBS-induced increase of PPI at 60 Hz and unchanged PPI at 20 or 130 Hz, as compared to sham stimulation. Conclusion(s): Our data demonstrate that electrical stimulation of the MFB modulates PPI in a frequency-dependent manner.

However, it does not delay or prevent the occurrence of dementia. The deleterious effects of dementia on QOL and activities of daily living (ADL) underscore the importance of identifying predictors of dementia-free survival in PD patients considered for STN DBS. Aims and Methods: The baseline clinical and neuropsychological data and the occurrence of dementia recorded during the longitudinal follow-up of a cohort of patients with PD with at least 2 years follow-up after bilateral STN DBS, were reviewed. Result(s): One hundred and sixteen patients operated between 1999 to 2014 satisfied the inclusion criteria. Their mean age was 56.5 (+/-10) years and the mean duration of PD at surgery was 11.2 (+/-4.2) years. During the 542 person-years of follow-up, 30 patients developed dementia. The mean dementia-free survival after surgery was 8.7 [95% confidence interval (CI): 7.8-9.6] years. In univariate analysis, the baseline factors of older age, longer disease duration, past history of depression or psychosis, freezing of gait in OFF phase, worse ADL scores in ON phase, lower levodopa response of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) III axial sub-scores, and poor performances in the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) were associated with a shorter dementia-free survival.

The present longterm study investigates cognitive status in all patients (n = 104) suffering from PD, who were treated via continuous bilateral STN-DBS between 1997 and 2006 in a single institution. Preoperative neuropsychological results were available in 79/104 of the patients. Thirty-seven of these patients were additionally assessed after 6.3 +/- 2.2 years (range 3.6-10.5 years) postsurgery via neuropsychological and motor test batteries, classifying cognitive conditions according to established criteria. At DBS-surgery patients, available for longterm follow-up (n = 37; mean age 67.6 +/- 6.9 years, mean disease duration 11.3 +/- 4.1 years), showed no (24.3%; 9/37) or mild preoperative cognitive impairment (MCI, 75.7%; 28/37). Postoperatively (mean disease duration: 17.1 +/- 5.1 years), 19% of the patients (7/37) had no cognitive impairment, while 41% of the patients presented with either MCI or dementia (15/37, respectively). Preoperative MCI correlated with conversion to dementia by trend. Overall, STN-DBS-treated patients deteriorated by 1.6/140 points/year in the Mattis dementia rating scale. Disease duration, but not age, at DBS-surgery negatively correlated with postoperative cognitive decline and positively correlated with conversion to dementia. This observational, ""real-life"" study provides longterm results of cognitive decline in STN-DBS-treated patients with presurgical MCI possibly predicting the conversion to dementia. Although, the present data is lacking a control group of medically treated PD patients, comparison with other studies on cognition and PD do not support a disease-modifying effect of STN-DBS on cognitive domains.Copyright Â© 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",Journal of Neural Transmission,14-Mar-19,,"Normal cognition is an established selection criteria for subthalamic (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) in Parkinson's disease (PD), while concern has been raised as to aggravated cognitive decline in PD patients following STN-DBS.

However, clinical effects vary and the mechanisms of actions are still not well understood. The aim of this study was to characterize neuroimaging changes that are associated with the responsiveness to the treatment. Material(s) and Method(s): We examined preoperative T1-weighted MR images of ten patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) treated with DBS of the NBM and correlated the clinical outcome with volumetric differences of cortical thickness. Subsequently, we sought to identify brain regions that carry out the clinical effects by correlating the outcome with streamlines connected to the volume of activated tissue. Clinical assessments at baseline, 6 and 12 months after the intervention included the AD Assessment Scale as well as the mini mental status examination. Result(s): A fronto-parieto-temporal pattern of cortical thickness was found to be associated with beneficial outcome. Modulation of streamlines connected to left parietal and opercular cortices was associated with better response to the intervention. Conclusion(s): Our results indicate that patients with less advanced atrophy may profit from DBS of the NBM. We conclude that beneficial effects of the intervention are related to preserved fronto-parieto-temporal interplay.Copyright Â© 2017 International Neuromodulation Society",Neuromodulation,Feb-18,,"Objectives: First reports on the application of deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the Nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) showed feasibility and safety of the intervention in patients with Alzheimer's disease.

We previously reported an exploratory Phase IIb double-blind trial of deep brain stimulation targeting the fornix (DBS-f) in mild AD (the ADvance trial). We reported safety but no clinical benefits of DBS-f versus the delayed-on (sham) treatment in 42 participants after one year. However, secondary post hoc analyses of the one-year data suggested a possible DBS-f benefit for participants>=65 years. Objective(s): To examine the long-term safety and clinical effects of sustained and delayed-on DBS-f treatment of mild AD after two years. Method(s): 42 participants underwent implantation of DBS-f electrodes, with half randomized to active DBS-f stimulation (early on) for two years and half to delayed-on (sham) stimulation after 1 year to provide 1 year of active DBS-f stimulation (delayed on). We evaluated safety and clinical outcomes over the two years of the trial. Result(s): DBS-f had a favorable safety profile with similar rates of adverse events across both trial phases (years 1 and 2) and between treatment arms. There were no differences between treatment arms on any primary clinical outcomes. However, post-hoc age group analyses suggested a possible benefit among older (>65) participants. Conclusion(s): DBS-f was safe. Additional study of mechanisms of action and methods for titrating stimulation parameters will be needed to determine if DBS has potential as an AD treatment. Future efficacy studies should focus on patients over age 65.Copyright Â© 2018 - IOS Press and the authors.

This is a non-randomized phase I prospective open label interventional trial of three subjects with matched comparison groups. AD participants given DBS for at least 18 months at the VC/VS target were compared on the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), our primary outcome clinical measure, to matched groups without DBS from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Serial 2-Deoxy-2-[ 18 F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) images of AD participants were also compared longitudinally over time. Three AD DBS participants were matched to subjects from the ADNI cohort. All participants tolerated DBS well without significant adverse events. All three AD DBS participants had less performance decline and two of them meaningfully less decline over time on our primary outcome measure, CDR-SB, relative to matched comparison groups from the ADNI using score trajectory slopes. Minimal changes or increased metabolism on FDG-PET were seen in frontal cortical regions after chronic DBS at the VC/VS target. The first use of DBS in AD at a frontal lobe behavior regulation target (VC/VS) was well-tolerated and revealed less performance decline in CDR-SB.

In this paper we investigate these markers and their relationship to key clinical milestones in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) operated at our center with subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) for at least 15 years ago. Patients and Methods: Retrospective analysis of available cerebrospinal fluid and clinical data in PD-patients, 15 years or more after they underwent STN-DBS surgery. All PD-patients implanted with STN-DBS at Sahlgrenska University Hospital before January 1, 2001, were regularly assessed until January 10, 2018, or until death, or until lost to follow-up. Result(s): Twenty three PD patients were operated with STN-DBS. Sixteen of these (six females and ten males) underwent at least one lumbar puncture (LP) immediately prior to or after STN-DBS. Their age at the latest available LP was 64 (55-75) years [median (range)], PD duration 20 (11-33) years, and Hoehn & Yahr (H&Y) stage 3 (2-4). Time between DBS operation and the last LP was 4.5 (0.3-10.8) years. Time from the last LP to the last follow up was 6 (0.1-18) years, and for the entire cohort 115 person-years. On January 10, 2018, four PD-patients (25%) were still alive. All preoperative CSF marker levels were normal. Between two days and six months after DBS, NFL and GFAP levels increased sharply but they normalized thereafter in most patients, and were normal up to almost 11 years after neurosurgery. Over time, all patients deteriorated slowly. At the last follow up, H&Y was 5 (3-5) and 12/16 were demented. There was no significant correlation between postoperative (> 6 months) CSF NFL, GFAP, T-Tau, p-Tau, beta-amyloid levels and the presence of dementia, psychosis, inability to walk or need for nursing home at the time for LP, nor for presence of dementia at the last follow up or for death as of January 10, 2018. Conclusion(s): CSF protein biomarkers remain normal despite long PD duration, severe disability, and chronic STN-DBS. They cannot be used for PD staging or prognostication but may indicate brain damage caused by other pathological factors.Copyright Â© 2018",Clinical Neurology and Neurosurgery,Nov-18,"amyloid beta protein[1-42] / endogenous compound

This study provides the first evidence of early alterations in performance induced by stimulation targeted at the fornix in severe AD patients. The performance of the five cases enrolled in this study was scored with specialized assessments including the Mini-Mental State Examination and Clinical Dementia Rating, both before and at an early stage after deep brain stimulation. The burden of caregivers was also evaluated using the Zarit Caregiver Burden Interview. As a whole, the cognitive performance of patients remained stable or improved to varying degrees, and caregiver burden was decreased. Individually, an improved mental state or social performance was observed in three patients, and one of these three patients showed remarkable improvement in long-term memory. The conditions of another patient deteriorated because of inappropriate antipsychotic medications that were administered by his caregivers. Taken together, deep brain stimulation was capable of improving some cognitive aspects in patients with severe AD, and of ameliorating their emotional and social performance, at least at an early stage. However, long-term effects induced by deep brain stimulation in patients with severe AD need to be further validated. More research should focus on clarifying the mechanism of deep brain stimulation.

sensory memory","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with deterioration of memory and cognitive function and a degeneration of neurons of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM). The NBM is the major input source of acetylcholine (ACh) to the cortex. The decreasing cholinergic innervation of the cortex due to degeneration of the NBM might be the cause of loss of memory function. NBM-Deep brain stimulation (NBM-DBS) is considered to serve as a potential therapeutic option for patients with AD by supporting residual cholinergic transmission to stabilize oscillatory activity in memory-relevant circuits. However, whether DBS could improve sensory memory functions in patients with AD is not clear. Here, in a passive auditory oddball paradigm, patients with AD (N = 2) listened to repetitive background tones (standard tones) randomly interrupted by frequency deviants in two blocks with NBM-DBS OFF and then NBM-DBS ON, while age-matched healthy controls (N = 6) repeated the experiment twice. The mismatch negativity in NBM-DBS OFF significantly differed from controls in both blocks, but not under NBM-DBS, which was likely due to a pronounced P50 increase overlapping with the N1 in NBM-DBS OFF. This early complex of EEG components recovered under stimulation to a normal level as defined by responses in controls. In this temporal interval, we found in patients with NBM-DBS ON (but not with NBM-DBS OFF) and in controls a strong repetition suppression effect to standard tones - with more attenuated responses to frequently repeated standard tones. This highlights the role of NBM-DBS for sensory gating of familiar auditory information into sensory memory.Copyright Â© 2017 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd",European Journal of Neuroscience,01-Mar-20,,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with deterioration of memory and cognitive function and a degeneration of neurons of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM).

Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale","Objective To explore the relationship of motor burden and educational attainment in patients with advanced stage PD. Materials and methods We included 102 consecutive patients who underwent a complete evaluation for DBS surgery, including detailed neuropsychological testing and UPDRSIII in a standardized Levodopa challenge. Years of education (YoE) were calculated as the highest grade attained in secondary school plus years for post-secondary training. Results The OFF medication UPDRS-III score was associated with YoE (p = 0.006; t = - 2.82) and age (p = 0.007; t = - 2.75) in our multivariable linear regression model even while including disease duration (p = 0.8; t = 0.21), presence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (p = 0.9; t = 0.16) or current IQ (p = 0.2; t = 1.25) as additional covariables. In a subgroup of 60 patients two years after DBS, the ON/ON UPDRS score was associated with YoE (p = 0.01; t = - 2.42) and diagnosis of PD dementia (p = 0.05, t = 1.95), while age (p = 0.08, t = 1.75), disease duration (p = 0.6 t = 0.48) and LEDD (p = 0.3; t = 1.05) showed no significant association to ON/ON UPDRS score. Conclusions We found an inverse correlation between years of education and lower (better) UPDRS -III motor score after adjusting for important covariables. Education may lead to an increased ability to compensate disturbances in basal ganglia circuits affecting not only for cognitive, but also for motor aspects of PD. Thus, educational attainment may play an important role in the concept of motor reserve.Copyright Â© 2017",Journal of the Neurological Sciences,15-Oct-17,"dopamine receptor stimulating agent

There is no clear evidence of reduced general cognitive function after DBS. However, a subgroup of patients develops dementia rapidly after DBS despite careful patient selection processes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the load of WML as a possible risk factor for cognitive decline following STN DBS. Patients and methods 40 PD-patients receiving bilateral STN-DBS were followed at least three years after surgery to detect dementia. All patients underwent comprehensive neuropsychological assessment and MRI before surgery. The extent of WML was assessed using an automated approach. WML volume was correlated to the onset of dementia and the decline of a cognitive composite score retrospectively. Results Patients with a rapid onset of dementia within one, respective three following DBS showed significant higher WML volumes compared to cognitive normal and MCI patients (55.8 cm3 +/- 18.836 vs. 9.3 cm3 +/- 12.2; p = 0.002). The same significant association was found in a multivariable model, including the covariables age, gender and PD disease duration (p = 0.01). WML volume was associated to the rate of decline in cognitive composite score within three years after DBS surgery (p = 0.006; R2 = 0.40) after correction for age. Conclusions Damaged white matter may lead to a reduced compensation of disconnections in cognitive circuits caused by the implantation of the DBS electrodes or by chronic stimulation.

In a recent multi-center prospectively randomized study, deep brain stimulation of the fornix was administered in order to ameliorate the cognitive symptoms and clinical course of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The study points to the possibility of modest slowing of the cognitive decline in AD in a subset of patients older than 65, while at the same time highlights the risk of stimulation in exacerbation of this decline in younger patients. The logic of conducting large clinical trials in the face of limited scientific understanding of the pathophysiology of AD and response of affected brain regions to electrical stimulation, is discussed with emphasis on the need to conduct: (i) animal studies in AD models, using precise focused stimulation; (ii) studies in patients who are implanted with depth electrodes for established clinical reasons (i.e., patients with epilepsy or movement disorders); and (iii) smaller adaptive studies in AD patients with systematic alterations of therapeutic parameters such as stimulation protocol.Copyright Â© 2016 - IOS Press and the authors.

treatment outcome","Background: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is used to modulate the activity of dysfunctional brain circuits. The safety and efficacy of DBS in dementia is unknown. Objective(s): To assess DBS of memory circuits as a treatment for patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD). Method(s): We evaluated active ""on"" versus sham ""off"" bilateral DBS directed at the fornix-a major fiber bundle in the brain's memory circuit-in a randomized, double-blind trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01608061) in 42 patients with mild AD. We measured cognitive function and cerebral glucose metabolism up to 12 months post-implantation. Result(s): Surgery and electrical stimulation were safe and well tolerated. There were no significant differences in the primary cognitive outcomes (ADAS-Cog 13, CDR-SB) in the ""on"" versus ""off"" stimulation group at 12 months for the whole cohort. Patients receiving stimulation showed increased metabolism at 6 months but this was not significant at 12 months. On post-hoc analysis, there was a significant interaction between age and treatment outcome: in contrast to patients <65 years old (n = 12) whose results trended toward being worse with DBS ON versus OFF, in patients>=65 (n = 30) DBS-f ON treatment was associated with a trend toward both benefit on clinical outcomes and a greater increase in cerebral glucose metabolism. Conclusion(s): DBS for AD was safe and associated with increased cerebral glucose metabolism. There were no differences in cognitive outcomes for participants as a whole, but participants aged>=65 years may have derived benefit while there was possible worsening in patients below age 65 years with stimulation.Copyright Â© 2016 - IOS Press and the authors.

young adult","Background and purpose: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) for severe Parkinson's disease (PD) outperforms the best medical treatment in controlling motor symptoms and improving quality of life. Nevertheless disease progression cannot be controlled, and the development of dementia over time is nearly inevitable, often resulting in nursing home placement. Ten-year survival, development of hallucinations, dementia and nursing home placement were examined and adverse events were assessed. Method(s): Patient files were scrutinized from baseline up to 10 years of treatment or death on all 79 PD patients treated with DBS of the subthalamic nucleus from 1998 to 2003 at Aarhus University Hospital. Result(s): Twenty-four patients died during the follow-up period of 10 years. Age above 60 years at surgery increased mortality 2.3-fold (P = 0.04). Of the 55 surviving patients 29 (53%) were demented and 19 (35%) were in nurs-ing homes. Average time from operation to dementia was 5.6 +/- 2.9 years. Hallucinations and nursing home placement were associated with increased mortality. Conclusion(s): Survival of 70% after a mean of 25 years of PD including 10 years with DBS illustrates that this is a selected group of PD patients. The prevalence of dementia steadily increased after surgery as expected from disease progression and can be an early event. Compared with the few similar long-term studies, the present study presents a larger cohort followed at the same DBS center for a longer period of time and none was lost to follow-up, making conclusions more valid.

New methods, such as deep brain stimulation (DBS), are currently being tested to decrease the progression of AD. DBS is an approved method in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, and its suitability for the treatment of AD patients is currently under experimental investigation. To evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of this new treatment, it is important to assess potential side effects of DBS regarding the nucleus basalis of Meynert; this new treatment is thought to positively affect cognition and might counteract the deterioration of nutritional status and progressive weight loss observed in AD. This study aims to assess the nutritional status of patients with AD before receiving DBS of the nucleus basalis of Meynert and after 1 year, and to analyze potential associations between changes in cognition and nutritional status. Design(s): A 1-year phase I proof-of-concept study. Setting(s): The Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the University of Cologne. Participant(s): We assessed a consecutive sample of patients with mild to moderate AD (n=6) who fulfilled the inclusion criteria and provided written informed consent. Intervention(s): Bilateral low-frequency DBS of the nucleus basalis of Meynert. Measurements: Nutritional status was assessed using a modified Mini Nutritional Assessment, bioelectrical impedance analysis, a completed 3-day food diary, and analysis of serum levels of vitamin B12 and folate. Result(s): With a normal body mass index (BMI) at baseline (mean 23.75 kg/m2) and after 1 year (mean 24.59 kg/m2), all but one patient gained body weight during the period of the pilot study (mean 2.38 kg, 3.81% of body weight). This was reflected in a mainly stable or improved body composition, assessed by bioelectrical impedance analysis, in five of the six patients. Mean energy intake increased from 1534 kcal/day (min 1037, max 2370) at baseline to 1736 kcal/day (min 1010, max 2663) after 1 year, leading to the improved fulfillment of energy needs in four patients. The only nutritional factors that were associated with changes in cognition were vitamin B12 level at baseline (Spearman's rho = 0.943, p = 0.005) and changes in vitamin B12 level (Spearman's rho = -0.829, p = 0.042). Conclusion(s): Patients with AD that received DBS of the nucleus basalis of Meynert demonstrated a mainly stable nutritional status within a 1-year period.

A reduction of cholinergic innervation can lead to pathophysiological changes of neurotransmission and is observed in Alzheimer's disease. Here we report on six patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) treated with bilateral low-frequency deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM). During a four-week double-blind sham-controlled phase and a subsequent 11-month follow-up open label period, clinical outcome was assessed by neuropsychological examination using the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - cognitive subscale as the primary outcome measure. Electroencephalography and 18F-fluoro-desoxyglucose positron emission tomography were, besides others, secondary endpoints. On the basis of stable or improved primary outcome parameters twelve months after surgery, four of the six patients were considered responders.

To date, there is no evidence that DBS counteracts progressive neurodegeneration in any particular disorder. Objective/Hypothesis: We hypothesized that DBS applied to the fornix in patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) could have an effect on brain structure. Method(s): In six AD patients receiving fornix DBS, we used structural MRI to assess one-year change in hippocampal, fornix, and mammillary body volume. We also used deformation-based morphometry to identify whole-brain structural changes. We correlated volumetric changes to hippocampal glucose metabolism.We also compared volumetric changes to those in an age-, sex-, and severity-matched group of AD patients (n = 25) not receiving DBS. Result(s): We observed bilateral hippocampal volume increases in the two patients with the best clinical response to fornix DBS. In one patient, hippocampal volume was preserved three years after diagnosis. Overall, mean hippocampal atrophywas significantly slower in the DBS group compared to the matched AD group, and no matched AD patients demonstrated bilateral hippocampal enlargement. Across DBS patients, hippocampal volume change correlated strongly with hippocampal metabolism and with volume change in the fornix and mammillary bodies, suggesting a circuit-wide effect of stimulation. Deformation-based morphometry in DBS patients revealed local volume expansions in several regions typically atrophied in AD. Conclusion(s):We present the first in-human evidence that, in addition to modulating neural circuit activity, DBS may influence the natural course of brain atrophy in a neurodegenerative disease.Copyright Â© 2015 The Authors.

Result(s): We observed bilateral hippocampal volume increases in the two patients with the best clinical response to fornix DBS. In one patient, hippocampal volume was preserved three years after diagnosis. Overall, mean hippocampal atrophywas significantly slower in the DBS group compared to the matched AD group, and no matched AD patients demonstrated bilateral hippocampal enlargement. Across DBS patients, hippocampal volume change correlated strongly with hippocampal metabolism and with volume change in the fornix and mammillary bodies, suggesting a circuit-wide effect of stimulation. Deformation-based morphometry in DBS patients revealed local volume expansions in several regions typically atrophied in AD. Conclusion(s):We present the first in-human evidence that, in addition to modulating neural circuit activity, DBS may influence the natural course of brain atrophy in a neurodegenerative disease.","[[""The title/abstract implies that it is a review paper or meta-analysis"", ""No"", ""The abstract does not mention that it is a review paper or meta-analysis.""], [""The title/abstract implies that the study produced original data"", ""Yes"", ""The abstract mentions that the study used structural MRI to assess one-year change in brain volume and deformation-based morphometry to identify whole-brain structural changes.""], [""The study investigates deep brain stimulation as a treatment for a condition"", ""Yes"", ""The abstract mentions that deep brain stimulation (DBS) was applied to patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and the study investigated the effect of DBS on brain structure.""], [""The study investigates transcranial direct current or magnetic stimulation as a treatment for a condition"", ""No"", ""The abstract does not mention transcranial direct current or magnetic stimulation.""], [""The study investigates treatment for neurodegenerative disorders"", ""Yes"", ""The abstract mentions that the study investigated the effect of DBS on brain structure in patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), which is a neurodegenerative disorder.""], [""The study investigates treatment for dementia"", ""Yes"", ""The abstract mentions that the study investigated the effect of DBS on brain structure in patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), which is a form of dementia.""], [""The study investigates treatment for Alzheimer's disease"", ""Yes"", ""The abstract specifically mentions that the study investigated the effect of DBS on brain structure in patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD).""], [""The study reports on a measure of clinical outcome after treatment"", ""Yes"", ""The abstract mentions that the study assessed one-year change in hippocampal, fornix, and mammillary body volume, and correlated volumetric changes to hippocampal glucose metabolism.

Animal models and an open-label human trial have indicated that deep brain stimulation (DBS) of memory circuits may improve symptoms and possibly slow disease progression. The ADvance trial was designed to examine DBS of the fornix as a treatment for mild AD. Method(s): ADvance is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, delayed-start, multicenter clinical trial conducted at six sites in the US and one site in Canada. Eighty-five subjects initially consented to be screened for the trial. Of these, 42 subjects who met inclusion and exclusion criteria were implanted with DBS leads anterior to the columns of the fornix bilaterally. They were randomized 1:1 to DBS ""off"" or DBS ""on"" groups for the initial 12 months of follow-up. After 1 year, all subjects will have their devices turned ""on"" for the remainder of the study. Postimplantation, subjects will return for 13 follow-up visits over 48 months for cognitive and psychiatric assessments, brain imaging (up to 12 months), and safety monitoring. The primary outcome measures include Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - cognitive component (ADAS-cog-13), Clinical Dementia Rating sum of boxes (CDR-SB), and cerebral glucose metabolism measured with positron emission tomography. This report details the study methods, baseline subject characteristics of screened and implanted participants, and screen-to-baseline test-retest reliability of the cognitive outcomes. Result(s): Implanted subjects had a mean age of 68.2 years, were mostly male (55%), and had baseline mean ADAS-cog-13 and CDR-SB scores of 28.9 (SD, 5.2) and 3.9 (SD, 1.6), respectively.

Motor status was evaluated before surgery ('off' medication and best 'on'), post-operatively, and at five years ('on' medication and stimulation) using UPDRS part III. Axial symptoms subscores were quantified. Disability was assessed with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Development of dementia was assessed at 6 months and five years post-DBS. Results.

Patients were divided into PD-MCI or normal cognition groups at baseline, and then compared after 1, 3, 5 and >5 years of follow-up. Subjects assessed by outpatient clinical follow-up evaluation, not performing a complete clinical and neuropsychological follow-up assessment, were separately considered and rated according to their functional autonomy in daily living activities.

Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale","Background: Deep Brain Stimulation of the Subthalamic Nucleus (STN-DBS) is an effective treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD), but only few studies investigated its long-term efficacy. Furthermore, little is known about the role of PD-subtype on STN-DBS long-term outcome. Objective(s): To report the results of a long-term follow-up (mean 11 years, range 10-13) on 26 patients bilaterally implanted in two centres. Method(s): Patients were assessed preoperatively and 1, 5 and 11 years after the implant by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and a battery of neuropsychological tests. Stimulation parameters, drugs dosages, non-motor symptoms and adverse events were also recorded. Result(s): At 11 years, stimulation significantly improved the motor symptoms by 35.8%, as compared to the preoperative off-state. Motor complications were well controlled, with a 84.6% improvement of dyskinesias and a 65.8% improvement of motor fluctuations. Despite this, the UPDRS-II-on score worsened by 88.5%, mainly for the worsening of poorly levodopa-responsive symptoms. More than 70% of the patients performed in the normal range in most of the neuropsychological tests, despite the development of dementia in 22.7%. Age at disease onset, axial subscore in off-condition and presence of REM behaviour disorder at baseline were found to be associated with a higher risk of developing disability over time. Conclusion(s): Our study confirms the long-term safety and efficacy of STN-DBS in PD. Nevertheless, the functionality of patients worsens over time, mainly for the onset and progression of levodopa-resistant and non-motor symptoms.

Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale","The effect of subthalamic deep brain stimulation (STN DBS) on cognition in Parkinson's disease (PD) remains controversial, and it is unclear which factors are related to cognitive decline and dementia after STN DBS, especially over the long term. To this end, we analyzed the cognitive outcome of 103 non-demented patients with PD who were followed-up for at least 12 months after bilateral STN DBS surgery. Preoperatively, the patients were evaluated with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale and neuropsychological tests. The rate of global cognitive decline and the incidence of dementia during follow-up for up to 7 years (mean 42.4 +/- 24.5 months) were calculated, and preoperative clinical and neuropsychological factors associated with postoperative global cognitive decline or dementia were analyzed. The prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and its relation to later cognitive decline or dementia were also evaluated. The annual decline in the mini-mental state examination score was 0.4 +/- 1.7 with impaired attention and executive function and a higher levodopa equivalent dose at baseline being the predictors of a faster global cognitive decline after STN DBS. Dementia developed in 13 patients with an incidence rate of 35.7 per 1,000 person-years. Impaired executive function at baseline predicted dementia. At baseline, 63.1 % of the patients had PD-MCI, and these patients were more likely to develop dementia than those without PD-MCI. This study showed that dysfunctions in the frontostriatal circuitry at baseline were associated with a risk of subsequent global cognitive decline and dementia in patients with PD who underwent STN DBS. In addition, preoperative PD-MCI was a risk factor for dementia after STN DBS.

The rate of global cognitive decline and the incidence of dementia during follow-up for up to 7 years (mean 42.4 +/- 24.5 months) were calculated, and preoperative clinical and neuropsychological factors associated with postoperative global cognitive decline or dementia were analyzed. The prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and its relation to later cognitive decline or dementia were also evaluated. The annual decline in the mini-mental state examination score was 0.4 +/- 1.7 with impaired attention and executive function and a higher levodopa equivalent dose at baseline being the predictors of a faster global cognitive decline after STN DBS. Dementia developed in 13 patients with an incidence rate of 35.7 per 1,000 person-years. Impaired executive function at baseline predicted dementia. At baseline, 63.1 % of the patients had PD-MCI, and these patients were more likely to develop dementia than those without PD-MCI. This study showed that dysfunctions in the frontostriatal circuitry at baseline were associated with a risk of subsequent global cognitive decline and dementia in patients with PD who underwent STN DBS. In addition, preoperative PD-MCI was a risk factor for dementia after STN DBS.

This propriety might be used to slow down cognitive decline in patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD). We conducted a prospective study to evaluate the feasibility and safety of DBS in AD patients with mild cognitive decline. Inclusion criteria were: patients (<70 years old) with AD diagnosed for less than 2 years, predominant impairment of episodic memory, and Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE) score between 20 and 24. The fornix was stimulated bilaterally by electrodes implanted stereotactically in the hypothalamus. Clinical, biological, neuropsychological, and imaging evaluations were conducted 3 months before surgery and 3, 6, and 12 months thereafter. During the one year-period of inclusion, 110 patients with recently diagnosed AD and predominant impairment of episodic memory were screened. Only 9 patients (8.2%) fulfilled all the inclusion criteria. Finally, just one patient accepted to be operated (acceptance rate 11.1%) and completed the study. No complications occurred and the stimulation was perfectly tolerated. After one year of stimulation, the memory scores (MMSE, ADAS-Cog, Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test) were stabilized compared to baseline, and mesial temporal lobes metabolism increased. This pilot study provides new data about the safety of fornix DBS in the hypothalamus. However, it suggests that only a small proportion of AD patients might be interested in this approach and that the acceptance of DBS by AD patients was low, raising questions about the relevance of this approach to meet the expectations of these patients.

Objective(s): To test the hypotheses that DBS would increase cerebral glucose metabolism in cortical and hippocampal circuits and that increased metabolism would be correlated with better clinical outcomes. Design(s): Open-label trial. Setting(s): Academic medical center. Patient(s): A total of 5 patients with mild, probable AD (1 woman and 4 men, with a mean [SD] age of 62.6 [4.2] years). Intervention(s): Deep brain stimulation of the fornix. Main Outcome Measure(s): All patients underwent clinical follow-up and high-resolution positron emission tomography studies of cerebral glucose metabolism after 1 year of DBS. Result(s): Functional connectivity analyses revealed that 1 year of DBS increased cerebral glucose metabolism in 2 orthogonal networks: a frontal-temporal-parietal-striat-althalamic network and a frontal-temporal-parietal-occipital-hippocampal network. In similar cortical regions, higher baseline metabolism prior to DBS and increased metabolism after 1 year of DBS were correlated with better outcomes in global cognition, memory, and quality of life. Conclusion(s): Increased connectivity after 1 year of DBS is observed, which is in contrast to the decreased connectivity observed over the course of AD. The persistent cortical metabolic increases after 1 year of DBS were associated with better clinical outcomes in this patient sample and are greater in magnitude and more extensive in the effects on cortical circuitry compared with the effects reported for pharmacotherapy over 1 year in AD.

While STN-DBS often results in meaningful motor improvements, consensus regarding long-term neuropsychological outcome continues to be debated. We assessed the cognitive outcomes of 19 STN-DBS patients compared to a group of 18 medically-managed PD patients on a comprehensive neuropsychological battery at baseline and two years post-surgery. Patients did not demonstrate changes in global cognitive functioning on screening measures. However, neuropsychological results revealed impairments in nonverbal recall, oral information processing speed, and lexical and semantic fluency in STN-DBS patients compared to PD controls 2 years post-surgery in these preliminary analyses. Additionally, reliable change indices revealed that approximately 50% of STN-DBS patients demonstrated significant declines in nonverbal memory and oral information processing speed compared to 25-30% of PD controls, and 26% of STN-DBS patients declined on lexical fluency compared to 11% of PD patients. Approximately 30% of both groups declined on semantic fluency. The number of STN-DBS patients who converted to dementia 2 years following surgery was not significantly different from the PD participants (32% versus 16%, respectively).

Nevertheless, several heterogeneous factors, such as clinical phenotype, age at onset and genetic aspects may influence the long-term clinical picture. In order to investigate the main features of long-term Parkinson's disease progression, we studied a cohort of 19 subjects treated with subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation after >20 years of disease, reporting clinical and neuropsychological data up to a mean of 30 years from disease onset. This group of patients was characterized by an early onset of disease, with a mean age of 38.63 years at Parkinson's disease onset, which was significantly lower than in the other long-term subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation follow-up cohorts reported in the literature. All subjects were regularly evaluated by a complete Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, a battery of neuropsychological tests and a clinical interview, intended to assess the rate of non-levodopa-responsive symptom progression. Clinical data were available for all patients at presurgical baseline and at 1, 3 and 5 years from the subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation surgical procedure, while follow-up data after >7 years were additionally reported in a subgroup of 14 patients. The clinical and neuropsychological performance progressively worsened during the course of follow-up; 64 of patients gradually developed falls, 86 dysphagia, 57 urinary incontinence and 43 dementia. A progressive worsening of motor symptoms was observed both in 'medication-ON' condition and in 'stimulation-ON' condition, with a parallel reduction in the synergistic effect of 'medication-ON/stimulation-ON' condition. Neuropsychological data also showed a gradual decline in the performances of all main cognitive domains, with an initial involvement of executive functions, followed by the impairment of language, reasoning and memory. Thirty years after the disease onset, most patients presented non-levodopa-responsive symptoms, although the effect of both subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation and dopaminergic therapies still showed significant efficacy on the main disease cardinal features. Nevertheless, compared with other subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation follow-up studies, which included patients with a shorter disease duration at the time of surgery, a higher prevalence of axial and non-levodopa-responsive symptoms was observed in the long-term evaluations, confirming that several complex aspects underlie the development of non-motor symptoms and other features of Parkinson's disease progression, even in patients with an early disease onset and a prior long-lasting response to dopaminergic therapies.

levodopa / drug therapy","Clinical findings in Parkinson's disease suggest that most patients progressively develop disabling non-levodopa-responsive symptoms during the course of the disease. Nevertheless, several heterogeneous factors, such as clinical phenotype, age at onset and genetic aspects may influence the long-term clinical picture. In order to investigate the main features of long-term Parkinson's disease progression, we studied a cohort of 19 subjects treated with subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation after >20 years of disease, reporting clinical and neuropsychological data up to a mean of 30 years from disease onset. This group of patients was characterized by an early onset of disease, with a mean age of 38.63 years at Parkinson's disease onset, which was significantly lower than in the other long-term subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation follow-up cohorts reported in the literature. All subjects were regularly evaluated by a complete Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, a battery of neuropsychological tests and a clinical interview, intended to assess the rate of non-levodopa-responsive symptom progression. Clinical data were available for all patients at presurgical baseline and at 1, 3 and 5 years from the subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation surgical procedure, while follow-up data after >7 years were additionally reported in a subgroup of 14 patients. The clinical and neuropsychological performance progressively worsened during the course of follow-up; 64 of patients gradually developed falls, 86 dysphagia, 57 urinary incontinence and 43 dementia. A progressive worsening of motor symptoms was observed both in 'medication-ON' condition and in 'stimulation-ON' condition, with a parallel reduction in the synergistic effect of 'medication-ON/stimulation-ON' condition. Neuropsychological data also showed a gradual decline in the performances of all main cognitive domains, with an initial involvement of executive functions, followed by the impairment of language, reasoning and memory. Thirty years after the disease onset, most patients presented non-levodopa-responsive symptoms, although the effect of both subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation and dopaminergic therapies still showed significant efficacy on the main disease cardinal features.

Prospective studies have shown that although the beneficial effects of this procedure are maintained at 5 years, axial motor features and cognitive decline may occur in the long term after the implants. In order to address some unsolved questions raised by previous studies, we evaluated a series of 20 consecutive patients who received continuous stimulation for 8 years. The overall motor improvement reported at 5 years (55.5 at Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-motor part, P < 0.001 compared with baseline) was only partly retained 3 years later (39, P < 0.001, compared with baseline;-16.5, P < 0.01, compared with 5 years), with differential effects on motor features: speech did not improve and postural stability worsened (P < 0.05). The preoperative levodopa equivalent daily dose was reduced by 58.2 at 5 years and by 60.3 at 8 years. In spite of subtle worsening of motor features, a dramatic impairment in functional state (-56.6 at Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-Activities of Daily Living, P < 0.01) emerged after the fifth year of stimulation. The present study did not reveal a predictive value of preoperative levodopa response, whereas few single features at baseline (such as gait and postural stability motor scores and the preoperative levodopa equivalent daily dose) could predict long-term motor outcome. A decline in verbal fluency (slightly more pronounced than after 5 years) was detected after 8 years. A significant but slight decline in tasks of abstract reasoning, episodic memory and executive function was also found. One patient had developed dementia at 5 years with further progression at 8 years. Executive dysfunction correlated significantly with postural stability, suggesting interplay between axial motor deterioration and cognition. Eight years after surgery, no significant change was observed on scales assessing depression or anxiety when compared with baseline. At 8 years, there was no significant increase of side-effects when compared with 5-year follow-up. In conclusion, deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus is a safe procedure with regard to cognitive and behavioural morbidity over long-term follow-up. However, the global benefit partly decreases later in the course of the disease, due to progression of Parkinson's disease and the appearance of medication-and stimulation-resistant symptoms.

We hypothesized that fornix/hypothalamus deep brain stimulation (DBS) could modulate neurophysiological activity in these pathological circuits and possibly produce clinical benefits. Methods We conducted a phase I trial in 6 patients with mild AD receiving ongoing medication treatment. Patients received continuous stimulation for 12 months. Three main lines of investigation were pursued including: (1) mapping the brain areas whose physiological function was modulated by stimulation using standardized low-resolution electromagnetic tomography, (2) assessing whether DBS could correct the regional alterations in cerebral glucose metabolism in AD using positron emission tomography (PET), and 3) measuring the effects of DBS on cognitive function over time using clinical scales and instruments. Results DBS drove neural activity in the memory circuit, including the entorhinal, and hippocampal areas and activated the brain's default mode network. PET scans showed an early and striking reversal of the impaired glucose utilization in the temporal and parietal lobes that was maintained after 12 months of continuous stimulation. Evaluation of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale and the Mini Mental State Examination suggested possible improvements and/or slowing in the rate of cognitive decline at 6 and 12 months in some patients. There were no serious adverse events. Interpretation There is an urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches for AD.

HA has been found in advanced Parkinson's disease (PD), but no predicting value has been demonstrated yet. The identification of such a predictor in candidates for subthalamic deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) would be of value. Our objective was to compare preoperative hippocampal volumes (HV) between PD patients who subsequently converted to dementia (PDD) after STN-DBS and those who did not (PDnD). Method(s): From a cohort of 70 consecutive STN-DBS treated PD patients, 14 converted to dementia over 25.6 +/- 20.2 months (PDD). They were compared to 14 matched controls (PDnD) who did not convert to dementia after 43.9 +/- 11.7 months. On the preoperative 3D MPRAGE MRI images, HV and total brain volumes (TBV) were measured by a blinded investigator using manual and automatic segmentation respectively. Result(s): PDD had smaller preoperative HV than PDnD (1.95 +/- 0.29 ml; 2.28 +/- 0.33 ml; p < 0.01). This difference reinforced after normalization for TBV (3.28 +/- 0.48, 3.93 +/- 0.60; p < 0.01). Every 0.1 ml decrease of HV increased the likelihood to develop dementia by 24.6%. A large overlap was found between PD and PDnD HVs, precluding the identification of a cut-off score. Conclusion(s): As in Alzheimer's disease, HA may be a predictor of the conversion to dementia in PD. This preoperative predictor suggests that the development of dementia after STN-DBS is related to the disease progression, rather then the procedure. Further studies are needed to define a cut-off score for HA, in order to affine its predictive value for an individual patient. Â© 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

tremor","Aim: To describe a large family with autosomal dominant parkinsonism. Background(s): Seven genes are directly implicated in autosomally inherited parkinsonism. However, there are several multigenerational large families known with no identifiable mutation. Material(s) and Method(s): Family members were evaluated clinically, by history and chart review. Genetic investigation included SCA2, SCA3, UCHL1, SNCA, LRRK2, PINK1, PRKN, PGRN, FMR1 premutation, and MAPT. The proband underwent brain fluorodopa PET (FD-PET) scan, and one autopsy was available. Result(s): Eleven patients had a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD), nine women. Mean age of onset was 52 with tremor-predominant dopa-responsive parkinsonism. Disease progression was slow but severe motor fluctuations occurred. One patient required subthalamic nucleus deep-brain stimulation with a good motor outcome. One patient had mental retardation, schizophrenia and became demented, and another patient was demented. Three patients and also two unaffected subjects had mild learning difficulties. All genetic tests yielded negative results. FD-PET showed marked asymmetric striatal tracer uptake deficiency, consistent with PD. Pathological examination demonstrated no Lewy bodies and immunostaining was negative for alpha-synuclein. Conclusion(s): Apart from a younger age of onset and a female predominance, the phenotype was indistinguishable from sporadic tremor-predominant PD, including FD-PET scan results. As known genetic causes of autosomal dominant PD were excluded, this family harbors a novel genetic defect. Â© 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

treatment response","Patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) and motor complications can obtain significant symptom improvement by deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN). Very little is published, however, about long-term effect and disease evolution during DBS. We performed a 4-year prospective study of the first 22 consecutive patients treated with STN DBS. The patients were evaluated with Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part II to VI and a patient diary concerning on-off periods and dyskinesia. Patients were scored before surgery on medication and off medication for 10 to 12 hours and in four conditions 1 and 4 years after surgery: off medication +/- stimulation and on medication +/- stimulation. In advanced PD, a significant reduction of dyskinesia and off periods was present 4 years (90%/67%) after the operation. Total motor function on stimulation alone improved 55% at 4 years, compared with baseline and activities of daily living (42%). On stimulation, significant worsening of axial symptoms and speech was present from 1 to 4 years. To evaluate disease evolution, motor symptoms were assessed off stimulation and medication for 12 hours and were found not to worsen compared with baseline, which is remarkable in an otherwise progressive disorder. Five patients developed dementia. Severe adverse events were not observed.

METHOD(S): We conducted a five-year prospective study of the first 49 consecutive patients whom we treated with bilateral stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus. Patients were assessed at one, three, and five years with levodopa (on medication) and without levodopa (off medication), with use of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. Seven patients did not complete the study: three died, and four were lost to follow-up. RESULT(S): As compared with base line, the patients' scores at five years for motor function while off medication improved by 54 percent (P<0.001) and those for activities of daily living improved by 49 percent (P<0.001). Speech was the only motor function for which off-medication scores did not improve. The scores for motor function on medication did not improve one year after surgery, except for the dyskinesia scores. On-medication akinesia, speech, postural stability, and freezing of gaitworsened between year 1 and year 5 (P<0.001 for all comparisons). At five years, the dose of dopaminergic treatment and the duration and severity of levodopa-induced dyskinesia were reduced, as compared with base line (P<0. 001 for each comparison). The average scores for cognitive performance remained unchanged, but dementia developed in three patients after three years. Mean depression scores remained unchanged. Severe adverse events included a large intracerebral hemorrhage in one patient. One patient committed suicide. CONCLUSION(S): Patients with advanced Parkinson's disease who were treated with bilateral stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus had marked improvements over five years in motor function while off medication and in dyskinesia while on medication. There was no control group, but worsening of akinesia, speech, postural stability, freezing of gait, and cognitive function between the first and the fifth year is consistent with the natural history of Parkinson's disease.",New England Journal of Medicine,13-Nov-03,levodopa / adverse drug reaction / drug dose / drug therapy,"BACKGROUND: Although the short-term benefits of bilateral stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease have been well documented, the long-term outcomes of the procedure are unknown.

subthalamic nucleus","BACKGROUND: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been established as an alternative approach for the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). Recently, the subthalamic nucleus (STN) has been identified as the optimal target for DBS. METHOD(S): Thirty-eight patients have undergone surgery for advanced PD since 1996. They include 12 females and 26 males with a mean age of 55.6 years. The mean stage on the Hoehn and Yahr Scale was 3.5 (off condition). Electrodes (Medtronic DBS 31389) were stereotactically implanted into the STN bilaterally. Targeting was performed using computerized tomography (CT) scans and ventriculography (VG). After 4 days of external stimulation, permanent neurostimulators were implanted. Patients were evaluated preoperatively and 1, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Evaluations were performed in defined on and off states using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) as well as the Hoehn and Yahr Scale, the dyskinesia scale, and the Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Scale. RESULT(S): Significant improvement of all motor symptoms was found in all patients (UPDRS motor score 32/48 preoperatively versus 15/30 at 12-month follow-up, p < 0.001). Daily off-times were reduced by 35%. Dyskinesias also improved markedly (UPDRS IV: 3.2/3.1 [on/off] vs. 0.9/1.3 at 12 months follow-up). Postoperative L-dopa medication was adjusted (mean reduction: 53%). Complications occurred in two patients (5%) who developed infections, leading to system removal. Systems were replaced after 6 months. Two patients (5%) had a permanent worsening of a previously known depressive state and developed progressive dementia. CONCLUSION(S): STN stimulation is a relatively safe procedure for treating advanced PD. The possibility of readjusting the stimulation parameters postoperatively improves the therapeutic outcome and reduces side effects in comparison to ablative methods.
